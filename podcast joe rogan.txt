6:58
doesn't lose anything jill
7:14
i ate steak before i've eaten it oh i don't miss it
7:22
[Music] [Laughter]
7:31
how do you not miss it i don't know i don't miss it i stopped eating it when i was like 12 and then i just never found myself i would have
7:37
like hamburgers and stuff on accident and then my brother told me veal was here like an [ __ ] and uh i just i ate it and i was like
7:44
this is not good what is this mad fatty i'm not into it wow is there any animal you won't kill
Joe Rogan On Wolf Evolution
7:50
uh yeah i wouldn't want to eat a dog why not because they're cute i like them they're fun giannis papa's had this like
7:56
crazy explanation why we have this connection to dogs they helped us develop our frontal cortex or something
8:02
because they protected us in the night so we didn't have to stay up so predators didn't devour us there's an
8:08
argument for that i mean we we definitely turned them into dogs it was basically the bitch-ass wolves
8:14
the bitch-ass wolves that didn't want to hunt and you know kind of like coward and you know submitted themselves to us
8:20
and we'd throw them food and then they would bark when other things come near that's what happened that was the process a chihuahua is a [ __ ] wolf
8:29
which is wild yeah it's like they started out as a wolf but through selective breeding
8:35
they figured out a way to turn them into chihuahuas and why can they breed like with
8:42
close family members well they agree with dogs you know i mean no but you can breed the same family of them well the
8:48
same way people can you can [ __ ] your sister and make a kid but then it becomes [ __ ] right yeah but it doesn't you know it becomes a chihuahua
8:55
it's not death it doesn't definitely become [ __ ] it becomes [ __ ] when there's a lot of inbreeding right but people have been in
9:01
breeding forever i mean look at the english family the english royal families yeah you ever see those paintings of those old dudes like from
9:08
back in the day on the walls no what you know oh my god they're like horrendous they're all they all have like distorted
9:13
faces because of inbreeding because they would only have sex with other royals they'd all like problems and [ __ ] and like
9:19
their bodies were all [ __ ] up but it didn't affect their intellect in any way oh it definitely did yeah probably yeah i'm sure how could they run countries
9:26
because they were uh monarchy they were in charge already just like joe biden
9:31
i mean you think about it how could intellect how could he run the country he
9:42
that's a perfect example of like if you just get into a position where you're already in power people will protect you
9:48
they want to keep their jobs they want to keep that form of power because their safety is dependent on your power mm-hmm
9:54
so they just keep you there kind of as a puppet yeah and then they manipulate that was my theory about george bush jr
9:59
yeah they just they had him there and they're like let's just he'll let us run the country the way we want to well look who
10:05
he had for his [ __ ] vice president the ceo of halliburton yeah and they did the most transparent [ __ ] of all time
10:12
they gave halliburton billions and billions of dollars in no bid contracts no bid so no one no one's competing no
10:19
one's going i could do it for less right and they did it for [ __ ] that they blew up so they would blow things up and then
10:26
they would hire halliburton to rebuild it and he had stock and halliburton so he
10:31
was profiting off of the united states rebuilding [ __ ] that they blew up
10:36
because of his decisions have you met with people that are in these positions of power now no never i've avoided it
10:42
but they've tried to meet up i've had some opportunities to meet some people that i don't want to meet yeah
10:47
and no thanks how do you say no thanks to the people that do whatever they want
10:52
you just don't respond you ghost them you ghosts
11:06
i think by this point in time they probably don't want to have anything to do with me but i think in before like a
11:12
lot of uh the controversy and the spotify stuff they were looking at the
11:17
podcast as a way for people to get on there and have
11:23
a chance to shape the narrative you know i'm a friendly guy i'm a nice guy i'm not trying to play gotcha with
11:28
anybody yeah when people come on if they say they don't want to talk about something i say no no problem no people yeah i'm just interested in having a
11:34
conversation and so i think they would look at it as like a unique way to manipulate
11:41
public information or public uh concepts on things so they're doing that with you they're definitely doing it on facebook
11:46
they're doing it through news there's no no question about it they're doing it with everything everybody's compromised well
11:53
there's the the problem is the people that are actually doing it are also aware of it
11:58
and upset by it because it also affects them so you got people like edward snowden who get to a certain point in
12:04
time and he goes like what the [ __ ] are we doing and then he goes public with this right and now he has to ironically live in russia yeah and hide right from
12:11
the united states but that was he's that kind of guy because he's an internet guy when did you know you're
12:17
you were big enough that people could use your platform to manipulate the messes was there a moment where you're like
12:23
somebody hit me up and you're like oh [ __ ] i'm big enough that i need to start being watchful or wary i said just take
12:30
there's like a slow [Music] burn you know over time i figured it out yeah
12:35
it wasn't like right in the beginning the early days i'd have anybody on oh holocaust isn't real come on
12:42
tell me more afterwards people
12:49
started getting mad i was like okay i don't agree with him jesus christ that people are that i only
12:55
agree with this is gonna get boring yeah is that a thing you seek out like i want
13:01
people i know i'm gonna disagree with at least early on you'd be like well that's the only way it's fine no the only criteria is am i interested in talking
13:08
to them so i get like hundreds of requests right they all come in through the email and i
13:14
looked at them and i go where did this guy go he walked across
13:19
antarctica yeah i liked that i saw them those i've had a couple of those i got another another guy coming on uh soon
13:24
that's done some wild [ __ ] like that like those like it's just got to be interesting to me yeah like i had uh
13:32
kristen beck on this week okay she was a male navy seal and then became
13:38
transgender and then they have this is the one that's super hero and lady valor no the one where he was threatening yeah
Joe Rogan on Kristen Beck & Trans Women
13:45
she was threatened grabbed uh shapiro's neck shapiro goes that's not very ladylike
13:50
that's a pretty good lunch no he's hilarious ben shapiro's a funny dude um this is kristen beck up there so was a navy seal
13:58
and then uh decided to transition and become a woman okay but just super honest and open and
14:06
you know it's it's so odd because you used to be this badass dude with a beard and now she's got fake boobs and
14:11
but looks like a man yeah like dresses like a man like i don't think is like really trying hard right
14:18
to look like a woman just looking like herself does she talk about that yeah she mean she doesn't try to hide her
14:24
voice or anything she's not like uh what's that the chick from theranos
14:37
yeah that's uh whenever you see you spoke to her already yeah i had her on the podcast this week she grew up in a small town in texas and always felt
14:44
wrong always felt like she was in the wrong box yeah i always felt [ __ ] up she had no there was uh no manipulation
14:51
no no one was grooming her there was no it was a hundred percent just how she felt yeah and it's interesting because
14:59
you got to realize man yes everybody is different you know there's a spectrum this [ __ ] doesn't even eat meat
15:04
exactly i'm basically trans yeah basically kristen beck eats meat yeah
15:17
and that was the first time i had like extended conversation with a trans woman and by the end of the podcast not even
15:23
by the end but i was like no no this this girl is a girl yeah we had her boyfriend on
15:29
who said that he had done gay [ __ ] before and he's like but when i'm with her it doesn't feel gay
15:36
now if you've done the gay [ __ ] you know yeah no one knows how am i supposed to disagree no one knows
15:41
nothing no one knows better than him i'm down for people to do whatever the [ __ ] they want that's why you need to have some of this what is that well
Schulz & Akaash Get HIGH

17:20
[Laughter]
17:30
you don't have to drive right no think about it i feel like i'm being pressured to

17:41
pressuring you okay i'll take full responsibility
17:48
i got asthma take a real hit you're going to see krishna soon you probably have to ask me because you don't eat meat that's not a hit though
17:54
that wasn't a headache yeah yeah that was some real possibility oh he's eating beef tonight
18:02
[Laughter]
18:13
oh whatever bro who cares people that care about what people eat don't care about it
18:19
people smile the rules are different here in new york come on okay joe
18:25
before i get too high we have a we have a weightlifting question for you okay um al is incredibly diesel with his arms
18:32
actually has to not lift weights or else he'll get bigger he'll don't get bigger he has to actually not lift weights wow
18:38
but his legs will not grow at it yeah what will not grow at all what do you do to try to make them grow
18:44
squats dead lifts really you won't grow at all stop sweating consistently works out yeah
18:49
and the arms doesn't touch yeah well look at jon jones jon jones is
18:55
the greatest girl nothing jon jones is one owl's not like that at all with him he's like an amazing guy his girl and
19:02
everything else i meant about his athleticism john has tiny calves yeah they're tiny they're
19:09
like almost non-existent it's the craziest thing and he works out [ __ ] hard nobody works out harder than jon
19:14
jones just power lifted dead lifting squats yes calves are still tiny
19:21
tiny like tiny calves like it makes no sense look how little his calves are yeah like you can see there they're so
19:27
small and he's got like literally the perfect frame for fighting because he only has muscle where he needs it he's
19:33
got shoulders he's got arms he's got the cap he's got thighs he doesn't need his calves he's so long it's like he's
19:40
designed in a lab like if you wanted to design a perfect like physique for
19:45
fighting i think it's jon jones and he's a master at distance he's the best at using this gift that he has which is
19:51
being very tall for the weight class is incredible like for keeping a guy away from him do you think if he fought in
19:56
ghana he'd win you never know you know i mean jon jones is a tough guy to bet against but he's
20:02
never really fought a heavyweight he's trained with heavyweights for sure you know
20:08
and gano has the nuclear option on any person that lives any person that lives if in ghana
20:15
if he catches you with one of those ones that he hit rosen strike with or that he knocked out steep a with or or the
20:21
alistar overeem left hook oh yeah that alistair over him one was one of the most disturbing punches i've ever
20:27
seen a guy get hit with because he was off before like he went to the ground he got shut off immediately and his head
20:34
went almost all the way back like right he slammed and then came back and then he hit him with a hammer but i
20:40
mean his head went back while he was standing up yeah like pull that video up watch this
20:45
oh jesus christ [ __ ] me bro yeah and that guy he did that to that's alistair
20:52
over him yeah like that's a big guy like aleister over him is the former k1 grand
20:57
prix champion aleister over him was the strikeforce heavyweight champion alistair ovrem is a [ __ ] savage he's
21:05
really good so for francis to do that to aleister over him i mean aleister over him is one of the most dedicated
21:11
strikers [ __ ] you want to see how good alistar over him is pull up alistair overeem versus brock lesnar san marcos
21:17
this was back when they were how does that go
21:23
they were doing a smell test back then for steroids that's all they did yeah you're good
21:29
everybody passed it's so ridiculous when you look at brock lesnar and he's standing right next to like look at look
21:35
at the two of them how the [ __ ] did he pass anything they used to call him uberean back then
21:40
because like he wasn't like a real person yeah he was like a comic book superhero yeah his physique was perfect
21:47
and his kickboxing skills world class dude i mean k1 grand prix
21:53
champion when they didn't test or when they tested very lightly alistair was running the show yeah
22:00
i would love to see what happened if they just like let's testing
22:08
we're gonna do our best wait do anybody do any of the other organizations not
22:14
test they're not they're not testing right i don't know how they test they test depending upon the commission like
22:20
some commissions are very strict like you can't pull any funny business in nevada nevada's got a down pat they're
22:25
the best athletic commission they do the most big time fights they have everything smooth and polished yeah but
22:31
some commissions are wild yeah like like michael bisping got passed multiple
22:36
times with one eye yeah [Laughter]
22:43
who the [ __ ] let him do that i mean all respect and props to michael bisping because yeah when people talk about
22:48
toughness you toughness like to what extent what about a guy who loses an eye
22:54
and then doesn't tell anybody because he wants to keep fighting and wins 10 fights plus the world title with one
23:01
[ __ ] eye yeah that's crazy i don't want to tell a guy who can't do that yeah yeah you know what i'm saying it's like i don't want you to do that but i
23:08
don't want to tell a guy you can't do that hey why is it why is it that when guys get knocked out
23:13
they get chinny well chuck liddell told me that it's because your brain is trying to protect
23:20
you because it knows you're too tough and you're going to take more shots and it knows those shots are damaging you and so instead of letting you just be
23:26
tough and take it your brain after you've been shut off a few times just lets you go out quicker and do they know
23:33
the amount of times i don't no one knows because it it varies some people it's
23:39
they you you could also catch someone at a point in their career where they've been concussed and then maybe they've
23:44
been concussed at the gym and then they get knocked out one or two times that year and it's a real problem but then
23:50
they take time off and they come back and they're good so it's like is it that they're getting damaged a lot
23:58
in training too maybe there's lost a step are they coming into a fight damage
24:03
yeah because sometimes guys come into fights like uh shaw talked about that back when he was training with um uh all
24:10
those guys in colorado like they would have some crazy ass wars yeah and guys would get banged up really bad in the
24:17
gym yeah and then they would fight and they would already be kind of yeah that's the football thing yeah just like those guys are getting concussive
24:23
practice and they're putting them back out there job used to spawn with shane carwin yeah shane carwin's fists are two
24:29
of my fists not exaggerating he was a preposterous man and shabby is a spar that dude and
24:35
shane carwin was probably the single biggest one punch other than ingano
24:40
striker ever in the ufc shane carter went knocked a lot look at that was shane carl has a big dude he was a house
24:47
he was the interim champion and he almost got brock lesnar he had him [ __ ] up in the first round and he was
24:53
on top of him and beating the [ __ ] out of him but he gassed out all right guys we're gonna take a break for a second
24:59
because uh we gotta be less high okay and the way that you get less high
25:04
but still get high at the same time is with diet smoke okay we should have taken some diet smoke today matter of
25:10
fact because it can you know just give you that nice beautiful buzz instead of what um
25:15
i don't know what part of the episode this is on but uh as it gets later i'm way too high for the diet smoke that's for sure
25:21
i wish i died smoked it up and then i would be perfect they got delta 8 thc
25:27
okay delta eight thc is hemp derived federally legal yay
25:33
and packs the perfect buzz within each gummy you're gonna love the taste you're gonna love the high and you don't even

26:52
i know i'm out here he said let's get paranoid let's do it that was that was the message yeah let's get to there he
26:58
tech you text me like i'm bringing weed and cigars let's get paranoid i'm like i don't want the [ __ ] paranoid
27:04
cops on [Laughter]
27:11
there's some conspiracies i'm sure okay conspiracies a lot of them are just made up [ __ ] so i'm sure i'm in a few yeah
27:17
have you heard any about yourself no no i try not to listen to anything about me
27:23
it's just too dangerous i don't want to get my feelings hurt do you still get hurt by anything no i
27:29
mean you would i guess you're a human yeah people say mean [ __ ] and you read it you're like oh wow is that really me
27:34
yeah you know just like it's this you know louis ck said something interesting he goes it's just talk
27:40
right like people always just talk but it's written down so it seems like it's something more because people could read
27:45
it like oh because but people have always been doing that it's just talk but it's now
27:51
everybody could read what people decide to talk about you're just saying that because it's recorded
27:56
well because it's recorded and because of how you're doing it yeah you know like you just heard it if it's just mad
28:02
voices out there talking it's whatever it gets lost in the noise but if it's written and you read it then it feels more official it feels more weighty
28:09
yeah yeah i think there's something about how it being written down so it just feels real
28:14
yeah you know there's uh yeah amber heard started only fans did you see that
Rogan Reacts: Johnny Depp & Amber Heard VERDICT
28:20
did you really no he just wouldn't believe it he's starting a conspiracy right now
28:29
what do you think about uh the verdict well i think it was probably um good for
28:34
all people who believe in the truth and the problem is there's like this boys versus girls narrative that i think
28:40
we all get into on these things you know and there's a lot of guys who wanted a guy to win one of these things
28:47
yeah you know yeah yeah but it's just not good to not be honest and if you're doing that and you're
28:54
doing it to try to hurt someone yeah like if you're purposely
29:00
changing reality you're lying about what happened just to try to hurt somebody right you're you're doing a [ __ ] up
29:06
thing because you're pretending you're a victim and it's so it's not as simple as you're
29:11
just lying you're you're turning someone into a criminal you're pretending you're a
29:16
victim and it's if if it's all not true if it's all not true
29:22
it's a really bad thing yeah it's really bad it's just bad for all of us yeah so whether it's bad for w like someone said
29:28
that the the verdict is bad for women i'm like that's crazy they're gonna say that that's crazy
29:34
it's it's just not good to do [ __ ] like that do you think it's pretty some guy beat you up i
29:40
don't know i i could i you know you watch the trial and you
29:45
form your own opinions unless you're there unless there's direct evidence and other than the evidence of like the
29:51
conversations they had that they were both recording which is wild shirts like [ __ ] gotta get [ __ ] up before you
29:58
press record when they're arguing no did they secretly yeah yeah what's each other what your wife says
30:04
[Laughter] they twice record each other no i think they i think they both knew so they both
30:11
knew so they decided to have like a performance conversation
30:16
because that's because if you're recording it you're recording it knowing someone else is going to listen yeah so that's not a real conversation like
30:22
you're putting on a show yes yeah it's a it's a real it's like yes keeping up with the kardashians knows the camera's there yeah they know the cameras are
30:29
there yeah that's true they're putting on a show you need chris jenner on i don't need them yes
30:36
why do you need that i would what is that so fascinating there's a baby's never met a demon before oh my goodness
30:44
i said you can't just call people bro why because i downgraded her from devil
30:52
but isn't she just crafty yes i think that's right
30:58
well she's like made the most with whatever resources she had she went forward
31:07
that's the crazy thing is i'm trying to look at things with rose-colored glasses and [ __ ]
31:13
there's so much defensiveness in this world right now and there's so much like what we we think of as um
31:20
like things that are completely out of our hands like when you think of things like the war with the possible war with
31:27
ukraine that's completely out of our hands we're all just sitting here in a state of anxiety right like what are we
31:33
gonna do like if if russia launches a nuke if some wild [ __ ] happens if china
31:39
invades taiwan what are we gonna do so we're in this like perpetual state
31:45
of never feeling like i'm just living life because i'm living life under this
31:51
canopy of danger right and doom yeah and if it's not that's climate change yeah
31:56
if not if it's not that it's the new variance there's going to be new variants coming in january get ready
32:01
yeah it's like this const but we're just we've got to be aware of things but the
32:07
problem with danger is when it gets in the zeitgeist like that yeah it it takes
32:12
a long time to clean that out yeah when i was a kid the cold war days were happening and we were legitimately
32:18
worried that at any day russia could nuke the united states it came super close right
32:24
super close well it definitely did during the cuban missile crisis exactly yeah that was that was a little bit
32:29
before my time but that was but not by much i'm old as far as 54. but they they were worried all
32:36
the time man they had stop drop and roll or what it would just stop
32:41
going or something like that yeah you're supposed to have like that stupid stuff
32:46
yeah it was a stop drop and roll that's a furon that's a fire yeah yeah but it's like stop drop cover or something something like that but we when we were
32:51
in high school man it was a legit fear like when that red dawn movie came out yeah like there was a legit fear that we
32:57
were gonna go to a nuclear war with russia and we would all get wiped out and everybody had this kind of anxiety
33:03
about it it like stuck with you and then when when the soviet union fell that all
33:08
went away and for a brief moment of time it felt relaxed it really did yeah it
33:14
felt like we don't have to worry about nuclear war we just have to worry about [ __ ] up wars we just have to wear these hot wars they're shooting tanks at
33:20
each other in the desert yeah yeah as long as we have to worry about nuclear war you know so we like accepted a certain
33:27
level of war and now the nuclear war part is back on the table and i think that's one of the things that it flavors
33:34
all of our conversations whether we realize it or not is we're all under this like steady state of anxiety yes
33:40
and then climate change yeah and it's not saying don't do things about climate change we should but yeah
33:45
all this how dare you all that why is that advantageous to keep us in a steady
33:50
state of anxiety it's not that it's advantageous it's it's human nature to like seek that
33:57
it's human nature to try to find the danger the problem is you're not supposed to know about danger
34:02
with seven billion people yeah it's too many [ __ ] people you're supposed to know about danger in your community yeah
34:09
like you're supposed to have a small tribe of 150 or so people and you know about everything you can't eat and you
34:15
know about all the people that are dangerous yeah yeah it's like 70 people like the dunbar number i think it's 101.
34:22
but it's actually tiered i didn't know it was tiered it's uh the dunbar's number is you get a certain amount of
34:28
like intimate close friends that you know well and then from there on it's like you had 50 people who you know
34:34
their neighbor you don't know too much about them and then there's like a yeah 1500 people you can recognize 500
34:40
acquaintances 150 meaningful contacts 50 friends 15 good friends yeah interesting
34:48
all of that someone's got to get kind of loved once you know a lot of cool people we know a lot of cool people yeah yeah
34:53
someone's going to get cut you got to get cut from my top 15.
34:59
it's like where's my space in the everybody's like bro why am i not in your top nine
35:04
remember that your friends would want to be the top five like okay all right man this is so silly
35:11
it's your myspace list just all over that's your dunbar number bro
35:16
that's the thing that's like i think we really are only designed to interact with a certain amount of people
35:21
i think that's why interaction on social media is so like hostile it's so it's it's not normal you're not
35:28
supposed to be interacting with that many people it's like you've got data coming out it's like it's like too much and i can't care
35:34
about you i just have too many people it's too much that's 1500. yeah i don't give a [ __ ] but do our brains adapt over
35:40
time you think i think they do i think our brains are going to evolve and they're going to eventually whether it's
35:46
through electronic intervention which is the most likely scenario that they put something in our brains and it allows us
35:54
to interface with each other in a different way and elon the way elon described it
35:59
he said you're going to be able to talk without words that's neuroline yeah this is his version of it but i'm sure there's
36:06
multiple versions do you think we see that in our lifetime yes yes i think we see that way quicker than
36:11
we think i think how cell phones took over when cell phones went from being like
36:17
who has a look at michael douglas on the beach with that [ __ ] friend greed is good [ __ ]
36:22
[Laughter]
36:39

38:33
that if you put a pee under her it's only she can't it was the inbreeding dude her body just i was thinking that
38:39

is you find your own ways through things you know you find your own ways through
43:39
things and i was talking about you the other day in the green room at the vulcan in austin i said think about it like you can't even say turn your phone
43:46

43:52
anymore i agree no one else can say that you can't you figured out how to own turn your phone sideways
43:58
i've stolen we did it we did it but that's a weird one that's a weird i can't steal that one it's like wow how
44:03

44:09
was falling apart when no one was doing anything yeah you put your [ __ ] all out on youtube blows up
44:15
yeah and then you put together this place this is cool as [ __ ] we did we did all these guys yeah no no no i know i know
44:22
there's other people involved i'm just trying to tell you well thank you what you're doing what you're doing is awesome what you're doing gives me hope
44:29
because you're doing exactly what with the cameras are off what you do when the cameras are on the way we talk [ __ ] when
44:36
the cameras are off is the way we talk [ __ ] when the cameras are on you're a real dude and it's it's so important for people
44:43
like that and akash i really wish you would go back to eating meat thank you
44:52
you know the fact that you you've carved your own show you got
44:57
your own vibe to your show you know it's like your show is a fun silly hang on
45:03
you know but you could talk about serious [ __ ] too like you can flow back and forth between serious [ __ ] and
45:08
complete preposterous conversations the only way it's fun it's so fun we're so
45:14
lucky that we get to do this aren't you some of them scientists you were talking to had a [ __ ] joke in their body
45:20
sometimes but sometimes i want to talk to them too you know i mean even if they're dry like i want to
45:26
extract like what you need a person who thinks like that yeah yeah that's what's fascinating to me because i'm so dumb yo
45:33
this is the biggest cat in the world bro you telling people you're dumb is [ __ ] no no i'm dumb compared to
45:39
these people completely no no listen to me listen to me they're good at work do you know how to play pool yes okay me too i'm one of best players
45:46
ever let me tell you something i know how to play pool but i suck i don't suck compared to you i'll [ __ ] you up
45:54
compared to regular people right or rather compared to professionals yes there's levels yeah and i am [ __ ]
46:01
dumb when i talk to elon musk i'm very aware how dumb i am really yes when i talk to lex friedman when i talk to him
46:06
but if you talk to elon about emotions if you talk to elon about emotions and
46:12
human interaction probably you're much smarter than him he's not dumb in that regard he's a different kind of human
46:17
man like that's an unusual combination of characteristics he likes to make jokes
46:22
he takes a picture of bill gates and then he puts it next to a pregnant man emoji and it says here's a quick way to
46:29
lose your boner yeah or if you want to lose your boner really quick that's what he said he post that
46:35
yeah he put he's the richest man in the world and he's dunking on other billionaires i love that no you gotta
46:41
celebrate that i love you and he loves that nature of the internet and the thing that bothers him
46:47
is this idea that like one gatekeeper can dictate whether or not something
46:53
gets released into the whole world if you're using something like twitter like you could have an amazing story and they
47:00
can block it if ideologically they disagree with it like that's what happened with that hunter biden laptop
47:06
yeah what happened with that well they decided to say that it was russian disinformation and that um
47:14
you couldn't share the links on twitter or facebook twitter said that yeah twitter would not let you share the links and the link is from a story in
47:21
the new york post which is really kind of crazy because that's like one of the oldest newspapers in america hamilton
47:27
it's a long established newspaper and they wouldn't let you post it's not like some wild ass website right you know some
47:34
weird might be a real website it was [ __ ] new york post and so
47:40
when something like a twitter has the ability to just tell you what you can and can't
47:46
talk about yeah even if that thing is valid even if that thing what if it does
47:52
legitimately i don't know what the [ __ ] is in his laptop but what if it does legitimately point to corruption are we
47:57
supposed to just ignore it because we want to own the people on the right it's like that's what we do with pelosi right
48:03
what do you mean she met corrupt she's definitely corrupt but she's corrupt in a loophole way i think talk
48:08
to me she's doing a thing where her husband buys stock in companies and she may or
48:16
may not know things that would affect that that would affect the way that company yes and they if they're so rich
48:22
they did a thing on her husband where they showed like uh how successful he is in the stock market like compared to
48:29
regular people right yeah yeah yeah it's hilarious yeah and it's like it's totally there's no
48:34
way that he knows things she makes like 200 grand i'm not saying that he knows
48:39
he's not saying that he's just a genius great investor bro he's better than buffett that's always 100 percent he's a goddamn wizard he puts a wizard's hat on
48:46
and he finds the right things to gamble on yeah and he always wins i mean she's worth like hundreds of millions of
48:52
dollars good for her does she come from under again i don't think so i think she goes i respect that though because most
48:58
of these [ __ ] come from money they keep changing the rules of the game to help themselves at least if you were in the
49:03
gutter before and then you shift the rules up it's like well at least you made the climb a lot of these [ __ ] are just
49:09
born in it ah you're saying that she hustled for it yeah at least she got there on her own hey what is it about
Why Are Powerful Children So EVIL?
49:14
people that were born in it right like uh princes and why do so many of them become like
49:21
psychopaths i don't think throughout history wait a minute what do you mean you say first generation becomes
49:27
psychopathy a lot of uh like like sodom hussein's sons were some of the most evil people that
49:33
have ever lived they would do horrific [ __ ] there's stories of them kidnapping women on their wedding day like going to
49:40
them taking them from their husband raping them and feeding them to their dogs what that's hard yes like for real
49:47
yeah pink finish yes that's all that's left to their dogs yeah i think there's a
49:52
sociopathy that develops or sociopathy say it when you're so removed from any normal human interaction that it you're
50:00
not you don't like ever developing you don't get to feel bad for people because no one shows you the bad
50:05
[ __ ] so there's no remorse to feel i think so you're just like well let's just push this as far as i can push it i
50:10
this is a theory i just came up with [Laughter] but i dare you to debunk it i think they
50:17
get stuck in this idea like we have a human beings have this thing where we other each other you know like if if
50:25
you're going to go to war with that group even it's like north versus south america we can we can other each other
50:30
yeah and i think we could do that with anything yeah i didn't know that happened with the kids i thought the kids and i heard they're weak no i heard
50:36
they were awful but not saddam's kids i'm just saying in general i thought like the the kids are successful people as well sometimes but
50:42
there's there's a few of those instances of evil kings right that's like game of thrones remember jeffrey
50:48
he was an evil king like there's a long history okay of young men who take over
50:54
the throne from their father and they're just [ __ ] evil yeah well maybe they don't have the empathy because they didn't have to earn it like if you come
50:59
from nothing you have empathy for all the other people who have nothing and those kids who come from everything why would they even feel bad also
51:06
the reality the just the reality of violence was accelerated back then because people were doing sword fighting
51:12
yeah you know they were hitting each other with bows and arrows and hacking each other to death and so it was happening and probably like everybody
51:20
saw it right like the the amount of laws and rules that they had back when that
51:25
[ __ ] was going on yeah you used to see death all the time yeah i think about that now i i've seen a dead body like three times in my life yeah so if you
51:32
yeah i mean like my grandfather passed away open casket like that kind of thing but like back in the day they all sought
51:37
bodies yeah like you're confronted by life and death bookended all the time you know when they talk about like people the life expectancy the average
51:44
life is he used to be like 30 years old you know what a lot of that is it's the babies would die infant death yeah it
51:50
was like an average right it was a big part of it a big part of it was uh they used to have all these fertility rituals
51:56
back then they would do fertility rituals to try like it was like important to make more people and they
52:02
would be worried that they would run out of people oh yeah no wild so the fertility rituals are like the community
52:07
coming around to make sure that you have a baby well there's just so many infant deaths that they're like yo let's have
52:13
have as many kids as possible because so many died we might run out yeah been like that they did they had dances or
52:19
myths or stuff like that but like that was um there was a guy named john marco allegro who wrote a book this is the
52:26
sacred mushroom in the cross i was literally told them today i saw this thing yesterday with you okay go on this
52:31
christianity is like john marco allegro he spent like
52:37
just i think it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 14 years deciphering the dead sea scrolls and he was an ordained
52:43
minister who uh what are the dead sea scrolls the dead sea scrolls is the oldest version
52:48
of the bible i think that they've ever found in aramaic i think i might be wrong about that but it's a an old
52:54
version of the bible that was written on animal skins and left in clay pots in qumran and so they found these fairly
53:02
recently like i think they found them in the 20th century or the 19th yeah 46-47 okay so was the 20th century and so then
53:09
they started deciphering them and this one guy he was an ordained minister but then as he became a scholar of ancient
53:16
uh religions he became agnostic and but he was still on the dead sea scrolls committee so this guy is an
53:22
expert in languages they're trying to decipher this language and so his conclusion at the end of 14 years is
53:29
that the entire cult of christianity was really all about the consumption of psychedelic
53:35
mushrooms and fertility rituals and that the whole thing was a way to
53:41
hide this knowledge in parables and stories and that it was just passed down
53:46
and translated over and over and over again and lost like a lot of its meaning along the way when people stop
53:52
participating in the rituals but his belief was and he he was an expert in the origins of words and he
53:59
traced back the word christ to an ancient sumerian word that meant a
54:04
mushroom covered in god's semen because they thought when it rained that
54:10
it was god coming on the earth because that that was how things would grow
54:17
so when like if you have no science there's we know nothing scientific liquid exactly and then all of a sudden things
54:23
grow that is life springing from the earth yeah so it must be god coming fertile right so here's where
54:30
it gets more complicated mushrooms grow like that okay so you could have no mushrooms and you get out of your tent
54:37
and then there's mushrooms yeah like literally overnight there could be mushrooms so they would eat these mushrooms and trip balls yeah and
54:44
mushrooms in low doses increase visual acuity they make people hornier
54:49
they establish a more potent bond of community it it allows creativity that
54:56
is linked to the development of language can i interrupt you for one second we have mushrooms here if you want
55:01
i don't know do we really yeah i'm not doing nothing don't be scared
55:06

let's get back to the show the dead sea scrolls the way they found out what pieces were they had to do dna tests
56:21
yeah they had to find out which cow the pieces came from oh and then they put all the pieces where the cow came from
56:27
and then they had to try to piece it together it's wild [ __ ] that's insane and i i've never read the dead sea
56:33
scrolls but the people that read it say it's really fast if that's what it meant would you be a christian
56:39
come on now i'm not joining any groups man but i think that's a real problem with
56:45
people what do you mean groups talk to me yeah you join the christians and also the baptists are enemies
56:51
you don't like protestants anymore no you know like that's what happened with the catholics and the protestants in
56:57
ireland i mean there's obviously a lot more to it but you know it was literally religion versus religion killing each
57:02
other when one group finds itself they tolerate each other and then they don't tolerate anyone else that's the other we're talking about yeah yeah yeah i
57:09
mean that's uh that's a the history of humans yeah that's crazy do you subscribe to the high ape theory the
57:14
highest it's called a stoned ape theory yeah yeah that's done that's how mckenna's
57:20
finding mushrooms i don't know the best guy describing that is actually terence mckenna's brother dennis
57:25
and dennis is a real scientist like a rock solid scientist and the way he describes it he explains
57:32
why the theory has some merit he never says that it's definitely what happened but what is there
57:38
the mystery with the human brain size is that the human brain size doubled over a period of i think it's like two
57:45
million years which is extraordinary right they have no idea what happened and so there's a lot of theories i feel
57:50
like my brain is
57:59
come on bro tell us about these high-ass apes anyway i'm high [ __ ]
58:04
come on where's my stone date theory
58:13
bro but he's back he's back everything's good he was just covered by the bottom andrew's hallucinating yeah
58:18
it's okay let's go so that's the theory we missed the whole thing yeah i missed it was the
58:24
theory the theory is ancient primates yeah experimented with
58:30
mushrooms and they led to a rapid development in human brain size which doubled over a period of two million
58:35
years so the human brain size doubled and he thinks it coincides with the
58:40
rainforest receding into grasslands which would give to a lot of undulates
58:46
that would [ __ ] like cows and then on those patties they would find mushrooms
58:51
and they would try them out as a food source because ancient prime minister well that's the reason why
58:57
that's why india is so smart yeah you can grow that [ __ ] in a lab dummy
59:15
you don't have to put pesticide in the lab yes organic just means don't pesticide
59:20
wait you only eat organic no i eat whatever the [ __ ] i want to eat right he ate six burgers when we were out that one time oh yeah that is one time i did
59:28
now you understand why we talk about food with you joe i like to eat we met you to get a hamburger yeah you ate
59:34
three and then there was one more on the table and you just said this is nobody's right
59:41
because sometimes they leave them there because everybody's just ordering [ __ ] we got like giant trays yeah you want to
59:47
be wasteful i think that was a chicken sandwich too the recall recall alpha brand this is
59:52
what we think it is i think you have insane recall and you think that you're dumb but your recall like are you one of
59:57
the guys you could you know exactly what happened in a round of a fight that you watched 10 years ago not always no
1:00:02
definitely not sometimes sometimes i get it yeah a lot of times that's pretty crazy sometimes i get it wrong sometimes like oh i thought he did it that way hmm
1:00:10
cause you've heard athletes do this like bill russell could could tell you every single play of every game lebron lebron
1:00:16
they say can do it i don't know if i believe it that's interesting sean mcveigh sean
1:00:23
fighters don't have that well they've got a fighter's kind of goal number
1:00:28
no even when they win like sometimes they just get in a zone and then before they know it
1:00:33
they've won and then they'll watch it on camera and go whoa look at that like
1:00:38
almost like they don't remember what they did i assume if your life is on the line that's everything is heightened but you don't remember any of it it's just i
1:00:44
have to survive i don't think it's that as much as they're so focused on
1:00:50
delivering shots they're so focused on delivering shots until like getting a trance but what
1:00:57
about my theory you're the most good thing this series is great for [ __ ] shut the [ __ ] up
1:01:03
eat some beef right joe come on it's a really good forget the beef if you weren't talking about the toughest
1:01:09
people in the world you're maybe you're just scared theory would be great you don't think akash would be a good fighter
1:01:17
a lot of people smart guys are good fighters say again a lot of really smart guys well i was i didn't say he's a very
1:01:22
smart dude recall actually the worst recall yeah but you're smart man i'll be
1:01:28
reading [ __ ] and forgetting it in 30 seconds every time y'all asked me for something i talked about two weeks ago i'm like i
1:01:33
don't know man is that the case or is it just that you don't give a [ __ ] about what they were talking about like if something matters
1:01:40
to you do you remember i still forget dead ass i read what every hindu holiday means every
1:01:46
year and then i forget the next time it comes around but what if that's something you like is important like what if your wife is telling you
1:01:52
something that happened like i wasn't listening in the first place so what could you do you know that's that's that's nice well you don't
1:01:58
you see that that's not good don't do that at home seem to have a commitment to this ideology
1:02:05
it's his [ __ ] fault he got me high this chair goes back so far
1:02:11
you do have comfy comfy choices because i'm only back here like i'm trying to shoot me even
1:02:17
[Laughter] right here it doesn't make me feel like like sitting here like more casual it's
1:02:24
more casual it's chill yeah yeah like an office chair i'm always in like these little [ __ ] chairs that make you sit up like
1:02:30
this yeah yeah but don't these hurt your back no no
1:02:36
[Music]
1:02:43
[Laughter] who's awesome by the way yeah i love
1:02:49
that um why does he carry the animal himself if he has a photographer
1:02:55
well because the photographer doesn't carry animals for you yeah what he could think no no no no you just take
1:03:10
a photographer's an artist this is dumbass dude no i'm just saying i watch this [ __ ] all the time he's my motivator like i just love it he got great music
1:03:17
choices also you know what's interesting he's on the new york times best seller list oh really yeah and i don't know if
1:03:23
i'm supposed to say this because it's kind of weird but
1:03:28
he should have the number one book in um non-fiction but based on the
1:03:35
numbers but they put him in self-help instead which is like it's really weird
1:03:42
because he's number eight in the new york times on how-to books but he outsold the number one non-fiction book
1:03:49
and the number one audio book and didn't make either of those lists do you think they're hating on them i don't know i
1:03:55
mean why would you like it's maybe an idea i know but they shouldn't do that it's
1:04:00
so silly it's like you have an idea of who that guy is he's a super sweet guy wait what's the bad thing about it he's
1:04:06
a family man he's a bow hunter he's a very manly bow hunter but he's also an ultra marathon
1:04:12
runner he's a he's a savage i want to go he's a psycho i want to he's a psycho in the nicest way possible meaning that like he's the
1:04:19
type of dude that's like how many miles are we running 500 well guess a better pack of lunch and he just can go yeah
1:04:25
he'll just go he'll if he if his body doesn't explode yeah if he doesn't have a heart attack and die you guys meant to cross
1:04:32
the field he came to the special beast you should go hunting with him i wanna i want to go hunting with you never been
1:04:37
hunting i've never been hunting
1:04:45
but that was inside an rv with air conditioners camping listen camping is amazing but i recommend doing it where
1:04:50
grizzly bears don't live have you wait what why yeah i don't think i don't think i would camp i just i am
1:04:57
not interested in being around grizzly bears you have a fear of grizzly bears everyone should have a fear of grizzly
1:05:04
bears because if there was only one grizzly bear and it was a a myth like a
1:05:10
grizzly bear didn't exist but then it was in a movie and there was this thing that's a 900 pound predatory wild dog
1:05:16
that runs it just roams through the woods no fences yeah no fences yeah oh you want to climb a tree and get away
1:05:22
from trees break a moose's bat my friend watched through a scope he was looking through like a long range scope yeah he
1:05:28
watched his bear as it was chasing oh [ __ ] he's chasing him the bear caught up to the moose and
1:05:34
broke its back with a slap [ __ ] just bang and the moose is [ __ ] slams against
1:05:41
the side of this tree the bear took down a [ __ ] moose those are just running around yeah and
1:05:47
you're gonna you're gonna have a little cloth house that you sleep in but what if you scare them by yelling at
1:05:53
them well you might scare them off you can generally speak you're not gonna wanna kill you because
1:05:59
you're not a primary food source right they focus on what they try to eat they're trying to eat berries they're trying to eat animals they're trying to
1:06:04
eat a lot of fawns and calves that's what they want they want babies because right in the get out they're the most vulnerable and bears are on the hunt
1:06:11
right around there did you see this one were they oh my god it's the most terrifying i've said for years that bears are my
Joe Is High and Scared of BEARS
1:06:16
biggest fear and you guys made fun of me red line wait was it this is the polar bear this is the polar bear this one is
1:06:22
[ __ ] it's florida yeah there's mad bears where i live but what's going on where do you live well i grew up in
1:06:28
florida oh there's a lot of bears in florida but they were like little black bears they weren't even that big little but they'll still kill people but this
1:06:33
thing right here so this is this is him just being curious he's just kind of looking no no no no incorrect you don't think no
1:06:39
that's a polar bear he smells meat and he's trying to get in there and eat that dude that's 100 what's going on he's not
1:06:45
cheering you know that he's sniffing around what what he smells like look at this that polar bear smells that
1:06:52
man's meat that's why he's doing this this has nothing to do with curiosity he is trying to bite that box to eat that
1:07:00
man 100 million percent i mean this is insane yeah because polar bears only eat
1:07:06
meat they're not like any other bear they're the most predatory of all bears because they don't have any other options they
1:07:12
don't have any vegetables there's no grass all they eat is [ __ ] seals or anything else yeah photographers
1:07:19
anything that's there polar bears will come for you so what do you do in that situation dude pray i
1:07:25
heard the most terrifying story of these explorers they were on an ice breaker and they were on an icebreaker i don't
1:07:32
even know if this is true what's the nice tell you so they're out there in in wherever the polar bears live yeah and um
1:07:38
they uh have a leak in their boat they have to literally get off the boat because the boat's sinking yeah so they
1:07:44
make their way to an ice raft they get off the boat onto this ice raft and they wait and there's multiple hours
1:07:52
before someone can come get them and they see a polar bear and they see a polar bear on a neighboring ice raft
1:07:58
yeah and he's looking at them and he stands up and bloom comes up in the water and pops up on the next one next
1:08:04
to it oh and they're like oh man back in the water pops up on the next one next to it until he's right next to
1:08:11
them he dives in the water comes up onto their ice raft takes one of the guys
1:08:17
grabs him pulls him into the water swims with him over to the other one and starts eating him [ __ ] right in front of
1:08:24
those dudes holy [ __ ] so they're standing there going what the [ __ ]
1:08:29
[Laughter] do you think it was get away before
1:08:36
and then the boat comes so they have to watch them get eaten by a [ __ ] polar bear they have to watch their friend get eaten alive
1:08:42
[ __ ] they eat you alive too they don't bother killing you dude you died from like grizzlies or anything
1:08:48
like that no no i don't i do have friends that have been chased by grizzlies and attacked by grizzlies brown bears well most of the time it's
1:08:56
what they're trying to do is scare you most of the time it's like a female with her her cubs and you just zigged when
1:09:02
you shoot a zag that's his thing he thinks he could zag at the right moment there's no zagging with bears
1:09:08
and uh that's happened with friends where they got charged you know shot at them
1:09:14
um what happened with cameron no he never had to do that but um steve ranella from
1:09:19
that show meat eater has a horrifying story of they had uh shot an elk on a fognac
1:09:25
island which is this uh island in alaska where the biggest brown bears live these things are [ __ ] huge man like 11 foot
1:09:32
tall bears right they're monsters right and they kill this elk and when they went back to retrieve it
1:09:39
they noticed bear [ __ ] and they ignored it and they said let's just sit down have lunch and we'll carry
1:09:45
this beat out of there and they heard a noise and then they turned and there was this [ __ ] giant beast just running
1:09:53
through the camp and they all stood up and guys were falling over each other the bear was like running right past
1:09:59
them one guy this guy's name's dirtmouth wound up on top of the bear as it was
1:10:05
running down the hill [ __ ] for like 30 feet falls off onto the ground the bear runs
1:10:11
off into the woods and starts hoofing at them and they they scramble back to the camp they didn't have their guns on them
1:10:17
the guns were sitting there all they were doing was eating lunch they had no idea it was going to happen this fast and then all of a sudden then they've
1:10:23
got guns they've got to try to back out of there wow but the bear had claimed their elk
1:10:28
of course oh it took their kills he decided it was theirs oh yeah they got off easy just lost an elk who cares
1:10:35
who cares they're lucky that i don't even know if they lost the whole elk i think they only lost part of it i think they were in the process of cutting it
1:10:41
up and shipping it and moving and and moving it back to their camp which was like a couple of miles away in this
1:10:47
rugged terrain this thing just come out of nowhere yeah is it just the bear
1:10:52
do you have to worry about you got to worry about everything man that's the the thing that's great about the woods
1:10:58
is that it's a a human reset you you're when you're like legitimately out in the
1:11:04
mountains it's a human reset right because you realize like oh no one gives a [ __ ]
1:11:12
one gives a [ __ ] about you yeah everything here is trying to do their thing right the bulls are literally
1:11:19
killing each other to [ __ ] right they're killing you what do you mean they grow weapons yeah every year
1:11:31
the males will like they'll be competition whoever wins is the dominant male that's who the female will mate with dude
1:11:38
two yeah that's what male competition happened she's saying i'm going to
1:11:44
choose the dominant male because i want the strongest genes for my offspring yeah i control this because i got the
1:11:49
energy look they start smashing at the water those are two big ass bulls and they decided they both want to be the king
1:11:56
[ __ ] of the herd and so they have to go to war so if you are in the woods and you're elk hunting and you hear cloggedy
1:12:03
clack quack quack quack quack oh [ __ ] they're fighting and you clock quack
1:12:09
could run and kill one of those bulls because they're distracted yeah have you seen what they got locked up sometimes
1:12:15
they'll like lock up their antlers and they'll just die that way dude i've watched this personally from you know 50 yards away really it's amazing it's
1:12:22
amazing to watch it's wild yes terrifying and then what happened well
1:12:28
my situation the wind was bad and we never really could get a shot it was like there was too much there was too
1:12:33
many trees and [ __ ] for us by the time we got to them they had smelled us and took off what's the biggest animal you
1:12:38
could beat the [ __ ] out of i don't think i could beat the [ __ ] out of a monkey not really scared a monkey would [ __ ] me
1:12:43
what about a wolf i'm not kidding did you see that video do you ever see that video of a monkey who pulls that strip of that dude's head off oh monkeys
1:12:50

1:12:56
crisscross applesauce and the monkey comes and sits on him it's like hello my friend he's like and the monkey just
1:13:02
bites his head and pulls a giant chunk of his scalp off and runs away can you get that up i mean pulls like a [ __ ]
1:13:11
subway sandwich sized chunk of scalp from this dude's head i'm not bullshitting like this big do we have
1:13:17
monkeys uh in america no we do not what about south america south america has some monkeys yeah
1:13:22
arian foster he's a football player he said i could take a wolf yeah he's crazy we talked about on the podcast yeah you did a podcast together that's ridiculous
1:13:29
no chance no impossible even you you're no no no no no no chance no chance no chance you would get it's literally like
1:13:36
a machine that crushes moose bones okay okay so no animals a wolf's bite is five
1:13:43
times stronger than a pit bulls did you see this and their teeth are designed to crush both oh this is the craziest [ __ ]
1:13:49
i've ever seen what are you doing in this situation so this is a this is a family that went to thailand for like a trip okay if i'm not mistaken so they're
1:13:55
like hanging out and they go to like an orangutan exhibit and this is like one of the this is not graphic but this is one of the things that they do
1:14:04
i'm watching this lady get bit but she's just chilling there and then yeah they do like an orangutan
1:14:10
experience and this is what happens he walks up behind her mm-hmm she starts grabbing grabbing her boobs
1:14:18
smiling tongues out he smiles and then just dips but i don't think i would want to be
1:14:23
that close an orangutan ever in my life no yeah it's unnecessary if that thing wanted to it could pull you apart like a
1:14:30
roll of toilet paper just shh yeah you could pull you apart like you were nothing yeah these people like we
1:14:36
we think of our like oh it's something much bigger than me it's like uh it's kind of the same size as me it's not
1:14:41
even the same thing yeah strength to weight ratio we're made out of jelly doughnuts
1:14:47
that's what it is there's not a goddamn animal where you wouldn't be able to fight off a feral cat
1:14:53
bears are the scariest animal i'm glad we actually cleared that up i think they're one of the scariest i accept that as an apology but big cats might be
1:14:59
even scared yeah i'm more afraid of a big cat big cats are scared way more afraid about it oh bears i feel like i could get away or if i feel like i could
1:15:05
do something but with a tiger i'm being dead serious well the tiger a lion i feel like there's nothing remember when you scared me with the bear thing no
1:15:12
do you remember this i forgot where we were we're at some comedy club i told you about fear of bears and i was like on edge all day because i was like going
1:15:18
through all my childhood trauma of bears and then you just popped out of nowhere at the comedy club i think we're in like salt lake city do you have a lot of
1:15:24
childhood trauma with bears i mean kind of as a kid it was the scariest thing in the world because we would just be sitting in our house and all of a sudden all the trash cans would rattle and i'm
1:15:30
like six years old and all the dogs would start barking crazy and then we'd run outside there'd be a bear there and florida bears are like florida people
1:15:37
yeah they're all very very unpredictable smoking pcp these babies are crazy
1:15:43
unpredictable running from the law wearing trump hats and [ __ ] bro these bears have guns dude
1:15:50
and i would go inside i would just bump into one and i'd run inside and i'm like six years old and then my family found out about they bought a bear mask and
1:15:55
then we had a full bear mask and i'd be sleeping in my bed eight years old my brother kicks in the door wakes me up and crawling run
1:16:02
and i'd wake up and there'd be a bear this
1:16:12
and then they knew once i got comfortable with the bear mask then they just flipped the mask inside out oh my god it was like just a beige oh and then
1:16:19
we did something did we print out a picture planning to do it i don't know if we ever did it but we wanted to scare you with the full bear
1:16:25
costume i was terrified it's still coming oh my god yeah be honest please don't it's got a cup that's the scariest
1:16:30
animal real bears are [ __ ] they're weird to see because you you actually see them in the wild like i i saw one
1:16:37
grizzly and it wasn't a big one it was only about six feet tall but it stood up and it was looking at us it was looking
1:16:43
at us in a totally different way than anything's ever looked at me i saw a bear when i was in [ __ ] montana and
1:16:49
it's cub nothing it didn't i was biking bear might have been a black bear maybe a black bear grizzly bear
1:16:55
i swear to god in my life i was at my boy at mundo's my bachelor party we're doing a bike trip i don't believe
1:17:01
[Laughter]
1:17:06
he's not arguing with you he's fighting against the feeling the weed is bringing inside what is the feeling i don't think
1:17:12
i'm high anymore i think it passed oh yeah you're fine okay let's get him a little bit more then more afraid of [ __ ] give us give us a blunt because
1:17:18
we're in new york that's the way you are we gotta smoke a backwood oh yeah pop these out on the ground
1:17:23
bring the whole joint over here yeah on the ground now give the whole thing oh we got the dipped ones that's too crazy for me but
1:17:29
just bring out the whole thing over and then we can choose so here's my answer on the ground a bear is not as scary as
1:17:35
a shark is in the water oh bro shark is the apex way more afraid of sharks way more
1:17:41
afraid of uh alligators way more afraid of have you ever smoked a backwood joe
1:17:46
yeah you really have yeah who the [ __ ] is talking about i'm telling you it's not that unique to new york
1:17:52
no i thought this is like a brooklyn new york thing no they spread around charlie murphy introduced me to okay that makes
1:17:57
a little more sense the concept back in the day he was the first guy i ever smoked blunts with and i was like oh really i was like this is better
1:18:04
yeah blunts are better yeah wait you just have to admit that you're enjoying the tobacco like there's a conversation
1:18:10
online with me and wiz khalifa about that he's like why do you uh why do you like blunts i go i think i like the
1:18:15
tobacco he's like i'm glad you're honest about that a lot of people they don't want to admit that they like that tobacco part yeah
1:18:22
but the debate to tobacco is not good for you right but it's awesome but it's awesome i would smoke
1:18:28
that's why i like cigars oh yeah schulte after a few beers
1:18:33
i don't really like cigars that much but cigarette cigarettes are great i love a single you know what cigarettes do they
1:18:38
give you they give you a head oh that's nice they give you
1:18:44
that's good stuff cigarettes give you spoken in two hours
1:18:49
we talk about his legs
1:19:07
there's a real good argument he's the best ever but i don't think there is one best ever honestly why not
1:19:12
because i think it's like all there's so many variables there's like the quality of the competition there's the length of
1:19:18
the rain there's you know there's so many there's like weight classes like 125. yeah but
1:19:24
there's a real argument that mighty mouse is the greatest of all time a real argument did you see that fight against uh the muay thai guy yes that was sick
1:19:32
dude amazing i love that because he had to get through that first round rob tank yeah gotta go through that first round before he can uh do it mma it was a
1:19:39
crazy rule set i like how they did it he said get high son yeah they did one
1:19:46
more time one round mma yeah and uh and then one round muay thai one round mma
1:19:51
it only went two rounds yeah yeah all mighty mouse had to do was get through that first round essentially yeah and
1:19:56
then he took him down quick yeah he got his back yeah
1:20:02
i got another yeah yeah once he took him down it was a
1:20:08
wrap but it was so much it was so interesting to see him like respect the distance like that first round rod tang
1:20:13
was just walking straight into him he didn't give a [ __ ] mighty mouse even landed a couple shots and but the second
1:20:19
round when he knew that there was like jiu jitsu a player wrestling or anything to see him backing up keeping like four
1:20:24
feet in between the two of them like going i cannot engage with this guy because if he gets me on the ground from rat yeah yeah mighty mouse is legit
1:20:33
and him uh leaving the ufc and then going over and fighting with completely different rule sets too they have uh
1:20:40
they have a thing they did uh over there where they allow people to s soccer kicked your head on the ground
1:20:46
yes fire oh yeah you could knee to the head on the ground and you could soccer kick that's legitimately crazy
1:20:52
but is it that much crazier than the rules that exist yeah guys damn you're unconscious you can just kick the [ __ ] out no no you
1:20:58
don't mean when he's unconscious you mean when i mean when he's going out i mean he's still awake
1:21:03
yeah no he's right it's tricky it's very tricky the problem is it's like for us like for
1:21:10
one single below it's the one of the most powerful things a person can do
1:21:15
because you are it's a natural human movement right it's a natural human movement to just do that that's so
1:21:21
normal everybody knows how to run so anybody who runs can probably kick a soccer ball pretty [ __ ] hard and when
1:21:27
someone is going out and they're already like collapsed and the referee can't get to him in time
1:21:33
that person if you can't soccer kick them in the head might survive because you get on top of them and you ground and pound them maybe they deflect some
1:21:39
stuff and maybe they clinch maybe the referee like oh he might pull out of this and he'd go but if you were allowed
1:21:44
to soccer kick yeah a lot of those fights are done are done a lot of those fights are done if
1:21:51
you're allowed a soccer kick and you just go watch some of the fights in japan japan allowed soccer kicks but it
1:21:57
was different because japan allowed it in a ring and in the ring you can kind of move
1:22:02
around the ring the cage you can't go anywhere so soccer kicks in a cage are uniquely
1:22:08
problematic because you could get to a position where you're pinned your head is pinned the cage is here and a guy
1:22:16
could just punt your [ __ ] face which is you mean
1:22:21
i mean i can't imagine getting hit harder than that but it's happened and you know it's it's
1:22:27
been a big factor in the fights where it does happen where you're allowed to do that yeah are you allowed to kick a guy
1:22:32
or a knee a guy in the head when they're down and so what one fc i think has decided is they're gonna allow that
1:22:38
that's like this soccer kicks yeah they'll it's i've seen some rough ones have you ever would you ever get dropped
1:22:43
i've been dropped i've never been knocked unconscious but i got tko'd oh really yeah i got hit with i got hit
1:22:50
with a left hook and my legs gave up they went like point good night it was really interesting it didn't hurt
1:22:56
it was like uh it just they just shut off yeah they just shut off and then i got
1:23:02
back up and then i got hit with an uppercut and the referee stopped the fight but uh it was uh i was conscious the
1:23:09
whole time but i was aware that i was like ready to go out sparring never ever been close no never knocked out i've
1:23:15
been hurt for sure i've been dropped i've been um you know
1:23:21
probably i don't know how many times i've been hit really hard where i had to like go home but that's totally normal yeah that's
1:23:27
part of the problem with uh any kind of combat sport it's like when you're learning
1:23:32
it's not just the fights that you have that give you damage it's also all the training yeah like what shaun was
1:23:39
talking about with training with that guy shane carwin yeah he said shane used to like ring his bell all the time yeah
1:23:45
like that's where i would see a lot of guys that had like one pro fight do you know who jerry
1:23:52
quarry is how do you spell it oh the box jerry quarry the box yeah the boxer is a famous story because jerry quarry fought
1:23:59
muhammad ali and you know it was like a lot of people's eyes like wow how did
1:24:05
he hang in there with muhammad ali like so sort of like this story where people are like
1:24:11
romanced and like yeah he gave it a great shot yeah yeah but he was one of
1:24:16
those guys that was a very good fighter in an age of very great fighters and he fought
1:24:23
the best the best and took some tremendous beatings but his brother
1:24:29
who i think had very few fights had just as much brain damage as him wow
1:24:34
and his brother and him used to spar all that training and part of it so it's
1:24:40
not one or the others obviously fighting muhammad ali is terrible for your brain
1:24:46
yes right obviously all those other great great fighters he fought but those are probably his brain but those
1:24:51
sparring sessions cannot be denied yeah dude there's you know who uh james tony is [ __ ] yeah of course you know i mean
1:24:57
[ __ ] yeah if james tony was an amazing boxer and he also played um walt no no who he played frasier
1:25:05

i'm trying to tell your story i thought it was both felt like the uac once in pittsburgh and the day we flew into town
1:32:44
was the same day as a furry convention okay so we landed the airport yeah we get the rental car we're driving to the
1:32:51

1:32:58
jesus they're animals marijuana is not good for everybody ladies and gentlemen if
1:33:04
we've learned anything today it's don't give in to peer pressure imagine when some drug
1:33:12
addict offers you their daily drug of choice and you never smoke weed don't
1:33:18
listen to them grow he's much more high than i'm not high but i got a piss
1:33:23
well you should probably go ahead and do that hold on so the furry convention go you guys pull up so who is it it's you
1:33:29
who i don't remember who was with me at the time um it was uh
1:33:34
probably some of the folks that worked at the ufc were probably i don't remember but you remember that
1:33:39

1:33:57
uh dude i'm so glad normal people are staying here what do you mean he goes most of the
1:34:02
hotel is furry so i go what i go what's the big deal

1:41:25
what with this idea i'm gonna stab it when it comes for me but you ain't doing
1:41:31
[ __ ] [ __ ] you're doing nothing you ain't doing nothing but dying
1:41:36
you're not doing nothing it is humbling right you get arrested i was in a car it was in the car and i
1:41:42
was terrified why do white people do this [ __ ]
1:41:47
like are you just that bored
1:41:52
i was in a car bro why did we do it joe i felt pretty
1:41:57
serious i've never seen any of these animals in my life because i yeah but corey anderson hunts
1:42:03
that's a lot corey from now on at bellator used to be used to fight for the ufc where's that
1:42:08
cigar you want the shrooms no the cigar lighter here oh thank you
1:42:17
i don't get it you don't get it
1:42:23
because you haven't done it but if you did it you would get it like if you eat meat and you you actually get a chance
1:42:28
to go and get it yourself it's a different experience i remember talking to you about this i was like do
1:42:34
you think we'll ever get the dopamine hit that people back in the day got from like bringing a [ __ ] deer back to their tribe or something we'll never get
1:42:40
that level of satisfaction of like killing something and then bringing it back and then everybody gets to live for sure it's like if you you catch a fish
1:42:47
right you get excited why because a long time ago that meant your family would eat yeah that's why it's exciting oh i
1:42:54
got a big one oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] even if you're not gonna keep it even if you're gonna like catch and release yeah you're
1:43:00
still excited if you get a big fish feed everybody yeah oh i'm gonna live today i'm gonna live so that's what the
1:43:06
fishermen are tapping into the guys who are just releasing 100 yeah 100 percent
1:43:11
no one would deny that no one would deny that it taps into like ancient genetic
1:43:16
memories we have of catching fish to feed our village yeah we have a we have
1:43:22
a buddy i've been fishing before that's just boring until you finally catch it right but when you get one how exciting
1:43:28
this is like hey we're finally doing something well you might not be into it i'm not
1:43:34
saying that you're into it so much so that the boring parts like fishing is boring as [ __ ] until it's not yeah
1:43:40
that's what fishing is so if you don't like the boring parts enough to get to the where it's not boring
1:43:48
it's no big deal but the the experience you get when it's not boring is undeniable everybody when you catch a
1:43:55
big fish like oh [ __ ] yeah you sleep coming that's funny it's genetic man it's like in our system
1:44:02
that's gonna feed us that's why we it's a like a weird primal jolt of excitement
1:44:09
and it's it's built in memory because you had to have that because it would reward you for providing for your family
1:44:15
do people get that same thing out of a cooking i bet yeah like this is a satisfaction
1:44:21
you get from cooking i can't imagine it's anywhere near the same no not the same but i guess like i'm trying to understand like why there is this love
1:44:27
of cooking and it has to be baked into our dna a little bit because you're providing a meal for these people that
1:44:32
you love yeah it's not like it's probably more similar than you would think because i think like when uh
1:44:39
someone decides to cook for a group of people and they all sit down and really love it i bet they get an excitement
Hunting Elk is Like stand-up??
1:44:46
that's very similar to like when a successful hunter knows he's going to feed his family there's like a thing
1:44:51
like you provided like you gave you gave a bunch of people a good feeling that's
1:44:56
really what it's all about yes it probably is
1:45:03
i think it taps into like satisfying the the tribe if you will yeah right like yeah you're rewarded for it with a
1:45:09
dopamine rush yeah we're all little dopamine junkies i mean that's what you're doing when
1:45:15
you're trying to kill you're trying to get smashed you just want to get big laughs wait
1:45:20
does that does that feel like when you shoot the the elk or whatever with the bow and arrow like that's no no no
1:45:26
does it feel like stand up no no this is what's similar about them yeah
1:45:33
how do you you have to improv in that no no you don't you really don't but you do have to improvise sometimes
1:45:38
you have to move around colors yeah yeah but it's it's diff
1:45:44
this is why [Laughter] you can't let him get off with that
1:45:53
oh my god my most fun
1:46:09
moose
1:46:18
don't talk to moose by the way what is there the one animal that will kill you and the deer species what they'll chase
1:46:24
you down and kill you but how would they kill your dear they'll stomp you to death moose will they regularly stomp
1:46:29
people to death it's a normal thing most people avoid them at all costs but
1:46:34
if you [ __ ] up and you're too close to a moose they'll come for you they're different they're different than any
1:46:39
other wild animal because they deal with wolves so they're like real good at stomping feel good
1:46:47
that's what they have to do if you want to stay alive you're a moose
1:46:54
kind of everything near you so if you're talking to a moose in a
1:47:00
parking lot there's an anchorage alaska dude
1:47:09
you might get stomped to death yeah that's real that's how it will smith bro it's not a little slap that's a stomp
1:47:15
stomp they're 1800 pounds when they're the giant bulls yeah i might have made that
1:47:21
up correct check that number bro
1:47:27
no it's worse fat james elk remember we were talking about elk
1:47:33
fighting and how crazy it is yeah moose fighting is next level wow okay like elk is the welterweight division moose are
1:47:40
heavyweights these are double the elk double double the size of a dough up to
1:47:46
1400 pounds have you ever eaten seven feet tall huge they're [ __ ] gigantic
1:47:51
yeah i've eaten the most so what's more dangerous for humans 100 percent or bears bears for sure but
1:47:57
you can avoid the moose you can avoid the moose if you're really smart and you don't
1:48:02
frighten them and you don't get between them and their calves you're fine they don't want to [ __ ] with you they're
1:48:07
worried about you as a threat bears are worried about you as a threat too if they have cubs but
1:48:13
they also might be a predatory could be very hungry
1:48:19
especially like older bears like that guy grizzly band you ever watched that dog oh yeah yeah yeah that
1:48:25
one's crazy bro what bro you never watched grizzly no what's great it's the craziest
1:48:30
documentary ever well look at the size of these [ __ ] look at the size of these [ __ ] these
1:48:35
are like 1500 pounds or 1400 pounds they're like enormous animals yeah with huge like
1:48:42
saloon doors growing out of the side of their [ __ ] house look at the size of them they're immense
1:48:48
and for them to survive like they have to be able to fend off predators so if you just get too close to them they'll
1:48:54
just [ __ ] you up because they might they don't know what you are they've never seen a person they probably think you're a wolf
1:49:01
yeah you know if you get like next to a mother a mother um bull if there's a bull elk he might go
1:49:07
after you if you like interrupt him or if you get too close where he feels threatened by you but uh the the cows
1:49:14
will stomp you if they have children i have a friend who uh lives up there and my friend mike shout out to mike he
1:49:21
uh was on his horse and he was running from a cow moose she was chasing him and
1:49:27
the horse was running full throttle and barely getting away from this cow that had decided to chase after him because
1:49:35
they had gotten too close to her calves that's that's real world that's not
1:49:41
twitter okay [Laughter] are you [ __ ] people that are putting
1:49:47
your pronouns in your twitter bio look at that that's real world
1:49:53
yeah yeah we need to go hunting boys you know i want to go on i don't know if you've
1:49:58
got it bro so that if you have time to kill something i'll be honest i don't know if i need to kill you you don't you definitely don't i want to be around so
1:50:04
what would you do if you were on a hunt like what do you think his role could be no if you're gonna
1:50:16
this is how you should do it if you really wanted to do it okay if you wanted to go on a hunt you should go hunt something that's like ethical where
1:50:24
you really there's really there's an imperative like they have to remove them like wild pigs that's a great example
1:50:30
it's a great thing to hunt because they literally have to they it's a terrible the word call is terrible they're
1:50:36
killing them because there's millions of them they're destroying agriculture texas has a [ __ ] giant number of wild
1:50:42
pigs so yeah i can tell you that i don't don't yeah
1:50:50
those are so if you wanted to do a hunt where you
1:50:56
would get meat out of it you get the full experience and it's really doing good that's the best hunting it's pigs
1:51:01
wild pigs but i don't want to do that helicopter one i think that's a little easier no no no you want to do one like on the ground yeah yeah you want to do
1:51:08
like a real pig hunt and it's not that difficult these guys are shooting them at night yeah that's a lot of people do
1:51:14
that they do it with the thermal scope that's [ __ ] yeah i want to be during the day i want to there's two things going on at the same time
1:51:20
there's like how close do you want to get to a fair fight which is ridiculous
1:51:25
you don't want to get close at all so don't call anybody a [ __ ] two two you gotta eradicate that's what i'm
1:51:32
saying you gotta and what's the most efficient way possible is there an animal that doesn't
1:51:38
or vegeta that attacks humans other than i'm scared and i think he's a threat yeah yeah if if
1:51:44
they can eat you a lot of animals they think they can eat you a woman in canada got killed by coyotes she was 19 she was
1:51:51

1:53:40

1:53:53
that who does such a thing would he make your own show great
1:53:58
i want to watch your [ __ ] show just you made it all your rules you can't follow
1:54:03
everybody's rules isn't that amazing that that's like the best thing you can do right now is this
1:54:08
yeah like the best thing we could all do is this yeah that's the best thing that's why i did it dear yo this is
1:54:14
where i'm listen man it's no one's indebted to anybody we're all indebted to each other if there's only one person
1:54:19
doing it wouldn't be any fun i can't think of a single thing you might possibly owe me
1:54:25
oh man no one owes anybody anything you're we're all benefiting like
1:54:30
we all benefit from being a part of a group of fun interesting people we all benefit and it it doesn't like
1:54:38
you know you can make tallies and decide like who benefits this and who benefits that but it doesn't matter what what
1:54:44
matters is the only way any of this [ __ ] is fun is as if there's many people doing it yeah
1:54:52
the only way it's fun is if you have all your friends having a great time
1:54:57
doing the exact same thing like everybody's trying to do the thing everybody's doing their own version of
1:55:02
the thing i don't think you realize that is a completely different paradigm that's
1:55:07
like a complete that's not what we grew up in at all and i do think you are at the forefront of that you have to put yourself there but you are well we can
1:55:14
all eat this is for everybody that's brand new well you have to recognize where weakness is in you like where what
1:55:22
what bothers you about you you know and what one of the things that bothers what used to bother me about me is that
1:55:30
i would get weirded out by other people who are better than me at stuff and i would not like them
1:55:35
and i'd be like why do i not like them because they're better than me or something like what is that [ __ ] weird weakness yeah and i realized it
1:55:42
was like a fear that there was like a finite amount of success that existed yes and then you could only
1:55:49
you could only have a certain amount for yourself and if you
1:55:54
were around other people that were doing well would somehow another take something away from you yeah it's weird i used to hate complimenting other
1:56:01
people and i think i was just so scared to show any vulnerability that i wouldn't do it and now i'm like yo if i like anything you do you deserve all the
1:56:07
praise i never want to hold that back i'm just making this person feel not as good as he could yeah i learned how to
1:56:13
do that from a guy who was a pool hustler hmm i was really good friends with a dude
1:56:19
when i lived in uh white plains i always play pool in white plains i lived in new rochelle yeah new york and i met this
1:56:26
dude his name was johnny and he was like this mathematical genius who was also homeless who was a pool hustler whoa and
1:56:33
when i met him he tried to hustle me in the game i was terrible at pool like what are you talking about because i could tell he was full of [ __ ] he was
1:56:39
funny right and uh i saw him there a bunch of times we became friends but he was like the first guy that i ever met
1:56:46
that would tell you what he liked about the the stuff that you did like he would
1:56:51
come with me to comedy shows and he'd be like dude that thing that you're doing and he would like go into this like
1:56:56
explanation i loved it right and he would like like give you like i know your your generation likes to call it
1:57:02
give you flowers yeah he would give you he would give you love he would give you love that like i was
1:57:09
like oh nobody does this everybody like kind of like never compliments their friends yeah and i'm like oh this
1:57:14
doesn't hurt you to do that i'm like it doesn't change anything but that's what i'm saying is that's how different that
1:57:20
thought is of what you're doing is back in the day you were a legitimate hustler if you made people feel good about themselves you're a con artist and now i
1:57:27
was like that's just what we should do yeah well he was a con artist but not like in the sense that he like
1:57:34
it was almost like a half of a joke because he was a like a world-class professional pool player like he was
1:57:39
just crazy yeah yeah and uh he had all sorts of like he was always trying to convince me to drive him to harlem so
1:57:46
that he could see her it was it was a wild friendship because i was a young boy at the time and uh i
1:57:53
was pretty [ __ ] straight laced because most of my time like all through high school and into the time i was like
1:58:00
21 i was doing martial arts tournaments so i didn't drink hardly ever mostly didn't do anything i was pretty
1:58:07
like on the grind yeah then i met this dude who smoked crack
1:58:12
he did all kinds of drugs and he was gambling he'd stay up and sleep i would meet him in 24-hour pool halls like i
1:58:18
would have like an audition in manhattan in the morning and i'd go uh hey man i go i got an audition in the morning are
1:58:24
you going to be at chelsea and i'd meet him at chelsea village where he was sleeping chelsea billiards was a 24-hour
1:58:29
pool hall and dudes would sleep under the tables they would just go to sleep they didn't have a place to live they
1:58:34
just stayed at chelsea they they gave themselves prop like horror washes in the bathroom yeah you know with like
1:58:40
[ __ ] paper towels and uh but that was the first dude that i ever met that like he would talk about
1:58:46
like even people he didn't like he would have like like this guy's a [ __ ] [ __ ] he goes butt watch how
1:58:52
he does this fire yeah it was amazing like he would he would tell me what they did wrong and
1:58:58
he'd be like explain it's all [ __ ] egos all their old [ __ ] like they get scared when they think they might
1:59:03
win whoo like he had this like mindset of understanding psychology but he could
1:59:08
look at a guy that he [ __ ] genuinely hated and tell you dude he does that really well that's a beautiful thing
1:59:14
dude he he was a honest guy you know he was a wild crazy dude but he was an honest guy and he was honest about it
1:59:20
all the time so it's like i just sort of adopted that yeah so at the time i guess
1:59:25
i was like 23 or some [ __ ] yeah oh yeah when i met this dude yeah maybe 24
1:59:33
somewhere in somewhere in that range and uh and we started hanging out together and i was like what a [ __ ]
1:59:38
interesting the guy could play piano he could do math in his head like you could have a calculator and you go 500 divided
1:59:45
by six minus seven plus 11. you go 265. whatever obviously that's not what the
1:59:50
real number is i can't do that but he would literally be able to do it like that and we would
1:59:55
do it with calculators it was like a trick that we would do at the pool hall where people would like let him they
2:00:02
would gamble with it he would tell people he could do that he would gamble with it wow wow
2:00:07
and they would like do calculations and he could keep up with the [ __ ] calculator he could play piano again
2:00:13
with the mic bro he took a [ __ ] that accidentally uh
2:00:20
you ever you ever played fool a guy named nick shulman nick schulman i went to i went to school
2:00:25
with a kid and when we were in like is he a professional well he became a hustler wow this is when amsterdam was
2:00:31
like way uptown yeah i played there and there was another one on the east side called
2:00:36
york or something i don't know there was another one chelsea was the big one 86 no right here remember that there was
2:00:43
chelsea this is a great place yeah but what was the one on 86 between like
2:00:48
second and third or something anyway this kid in high school he was just like he would stop going to high school i went to middle school with him
2:00:54
we stopped going to high school and just became a hustler bro i don't know how these guys make money that's the thing you don't make much but the thing is the
2:00:59
camaraderie of the pool hall is so fun when i was a young man and i first
2:01:05
started hanging out in pool halls because i really didn't play until really didn't actually play pool until i
2:01:11
was 21 and i just had this girl that i dated and she was older than me and she was

2:02:06
[ __ ] and so i started playing pool with my friend john and we were hanging around these pool halls and i was like
2:02:11
oh this is like a weird thing that these people are doing but they're all figuring out how to control their emotions like this isn't as simple
2:02:18
as a game this is like all these people get together and they all puzzle on how
2:02:23
to control their emotions under extreme pressure and they're all trying to gamble more and more money to make the
2:02:28
stakes higher and higher but it's all about who can control their emotions and
2:02:33
who can keep that arm straight under extreme pressure all right guys we're gonna take a break for a second uh

we're hitting a lot of big cities we're selling the [ __ ] out what do we do this is what we do we sell this [ __ ] out the
2:04:29
way we're gonna do if the pandemic didn't stop us so go to akashing.com
2:04:34

2:04:47
palisades guys we are going everywhere go to akashing.com for all those dates and
2:04:53
plenty more this [ __ ] is going to be crazy let's get back to the show is elon compromised
2:04:59
what does that even mean well i don't want to say compromise like he might be compromised by the aliens
Is Elon Musk Compromised By Aliens?
2:05:05
yeah yeah because he was a little easy to dismiss aliens he goes like they're real they're very subtle
2:05:11
yeah he didn't want to go into it at all well i didn't like his pyramid stuff either one of the reasons why maybe just
2:05:17
like from a pragmatic perspective a guy does one podcast with me
2:05:23
i get him to smoke weed his stock drops you know
2:05:28
nasa's mad at him wait a minute hold on and then he bounces back and everything's fine so
2:05:34
next time on the podcast probably better to dismiss aliens
2:05:41
nonsense elon i don't know i don't think he has time to think about aliens dude runs five [ __ ] companies yeah for him
2:05:46
it'd probably be really convenient if aliens just stay the [ __ ] out of his way yeah he's got [ __ ] to do
2:05:53
like if they land it's gonna ruin everything like if the aliens land you know what kind of chaos it would be you
2:05:59
think it's bad right now with the republicans versus the democrats like what happens when the aliens land you
2:06:04
think it's bad you think we all link up that's the only time that's what we need
2:06:12
yeah from other galaxies
2:06:18
i don't know like are they bringing their good fighting stuff are they just exploring like when we sell uh send astronauts out to space we don't send
2:06:23
them with any good [ __ ] do you know what an eater robot they don't got guns or nothing what is that an eater robot is a
2:06:29
robot that runs on biological materials oh don't make that they mean those are the worst they've already made it
2:06:36
it's a robot that's powered by biological material so i'm i'm just
2:06:41
saying worst case scenario okay this is a robot that eats bodies on a battlefield oh god to stay to stay alive
2:06:49
and that's how it powers itself that's what you can say you could say no we don't mean biological material in that
2:06:55
way we need mean plant matter and you know dead rodents and what-have-you
2:07:01
but there's a real [ __ ] robot that they designed that eats
2:07:07
biological material who has it the u.s has it that's fuel it's called the e-a-t-r google it
2:07:14
e-a-t-r robot all right now yeah when do you what do you think of this
2:07:20
thing man there's a [ __ ] robot that it could eat bodies and it turns it into fuel do you think
2:07:26
aliens kill it i mean robots kill us oh yeah akash is a big uh robot i don't think they would want to yeah here's the
2:07:33
thing like why would they want to why would they not want to this is a cigar oh nice um well
2:07:40
it's not why would they not want to because they would not act illogically we would have to give them a reason to
2:07:47
kill us if they wanted to kill us robots are not just going to kill us for no reason right if we're not a threat
2:07:52
anymore what do they give a [ __ ] but don't we really make everything real talk everything worse for everyone
2:07:57
oh don't even say worse just say less efficient like it might be easier if we're out of here right yeah or just like if you're looking at the world and
2:08:03
you're like hey there's what's the biggest problem that's hurting the world it's humans it's not this is so hilarious we're so cynical we're like it's
2:08:10
impossible for us to change so uh let's just assume that we'll never stop [ __ ] all over
2:08:16
the world and the robots are gonna want to kill us i do assume that yeah okay here's a
2:08:21
question do you think it's unfair to tell okay i don't know how to wear this
2:08:27
you know how we had our industrial revolution right my man right that was like
2:08:39
but no no you know how we had our like time to [ __ ] the environment up now other countries get their time to
2:08:46
[ __ ] the environment well why can we tell them not to well we have no moral
2:08:51
high ground that's what i'm saying like we had our time in the sun now they have theirs it's okay let them use it
2:08:57
i mean i'm not aware of what the environmental regulations are all around the world obviously
2:09:03
i've not studied that but i i do know that it's a problem almost everywhere
2:09:10
where people burn coal and where people you know like coal burning is crazy you ever see those
2:09:17
documentaries on uh people that live and there's a certain area of indiana where there's a bunch of coal plants near
2:09:22
what's it called october sky that's what it was about yeah it's nasty like you go by people's cars you could just like
2:09:28
swipe your hand on a windshield and you have this coal dust like it's in the air people are breathing it right all kinds
2:09:34
of people are having all kinds of respiratory diseases as i suck on this cigar
2:09:42
they're poisoning people these people are poisoning people for sure and uh they're doing it in the name of uh
2:09:48
making power like a cold fire power plant that does that you should start it you go i have an experiment
2:09:55
this let's see what happens when we burn coal and make electricity okay let's try it
2:10:01
oh it's super efficient seems to work really well but it really [ __ ] up the sky yeah let's not do that
2:10:07
it should be like let's not [ __ ] up the sky yeah but back then they're like let's [ __ ] up this guy just in this spot
2:10:13
yeah that's what fracking is well [ __ ] up the water right here come here it won't touch the other water a couple of little
2:10:20
fishes and they get gas and electric to these people the indigenous communities need
2:10:27
electricity just fracking that's what they do though
2:10:33
and letting them make bigger casinos it's the craziest [ __ ] any no no [ __ ] predecessors of ours
2:10:41
would have never guessed that we'd be hanging on this long really like this
2:10:46
with the way we are like this yeah wait how much longer you think we got not much time wait really yeah i think
2:10:54
unfortunately the way things have unraveled over the last couple years i have zero faith that we're going to keep this
2:11:01
thing glued together for another 10 years or 20 years robots some cataclysmic conditions there's so much
2:11:07
things treat your generation thinks that you're living through it you're like oh [ __ ] can't get worse than it is right
2:11:12
now my parents never thought the world was gonna end in 10 years i'll tell you that right now tell that to the residents of namasaki
2:11:20
where's namasaki nagasaki nagasaki that would have been way better if i got the name
2:11:27
that's high bro mario yamasaki oh yeah i was thinking i
2:11:32
got my no i got my words stumbled i should have said hiroshima but i was trying to be crafty
2:11:38
i choked in the under pressure live podcast
2:11:44
[ __ ] i just want to apologize to anybody i might have insulted doing this podcast i've barely barely been myself
2:11:51

2:12:18
you know why did i think that was the best way to begin the podcast it just came to me in the moment i didn't think
2:12:23
about that much every podcast is like a small little cult that walks on baby legs and then it's going to develop a
2:12:29
little trot and then it gets going right
2:12:40
oh dude hey can we talk about one crazy conspiracy i got a pizza all right go go pee we got this okay do

2:13:53
extravaganza this is not my idea i said i would play along with it this is your suggestion he demanded it he
2:13:59
suggested that's true that's not asking that's true i need i need young me park's number
2:14:05

2:14:55
monkey self growing [ __ ] ear hair and [ __ ]
2:15:01
as you slowly fade away how long do you think you got us how long do you think you got jeff how many
2:15:06
years well if joe biden gets reelected i think i got about four wait really you think i don't know man i'm kidding who
2:15:13
do you think goes after just doing a comedy podcast
2:15:33
can i be compassionate can i be empathetic no you cannot that's what makes it unbelievable oh okay that's a good ass
2:15:40
point now you make a good ass point joe biden alpha brain black label go get some it's real it's legit it works yeah
2:15:47
i'm a living testament i barely got out of high school i have a phenomenal memory no your recall is crazy bro i'm gonna
2:15:54
take this [ __ ] alpha alpha brain don't just take that because i said to
2:15:59
you but there's a bunch of other stuff you should try joe we've been promoting alpha brain on this
2:16:04
alpha brain is great no no there's other stuff that helps your brain well there's stuff once you get chills neuro gum oh
2:16:09
you want to get bigger yeah he wants to get bigger not even big he wants to be like slim like his body is felt like a swimmer joe everything you take
2:16:17
everything everything that was sexual most of it most of it is like the the big results come from testosterone
2:16:22
replacement so there's that and then there's peptides that increase your
2:16:27
body's ability to grow uh hormones like growth and there's
2:16:34
magic there's uh yeah there's bbc one five seven and there's another thing now what dummy now
2:16:40
i think it's gonna go later bbc i'm [ __ ] these names up and then
2:16:45
another one's called thymusin and what these things do is they uh they help your body produce the hormones
2:16:51
that it should have when you're younger and your body works better and if you do that and you
2:16:57
regularly exercise that's the biggest thing if there's ever one thing that someone
2:17:02
can do to stop aging it's lift weights and don't stop and don't do it for vanity do it because you want to keep
2:17:08
your tissue like think of it as like age is like a little demon that's slowly robbing you
2:17:16
of your tissue christian your ability to walk upstairs your ability to open up jars your ability to open the car door
2:17:23
when it's frozen all that [ __ ] is real and the only way to stave that off is weight lifting you have to
2:17:30
lift heavy things and you have to you don't want to do anything too heavy when you hurt yourself but you want to get
2:17:35
your body accustomed to this idea that in order to survive it has to lift
2:17:41
things and you need to give that body nutrients and i don't care if you like lift your own body your body's heavy you
2:17:46
can do chin-ups and push-ups and body squats that's all great stuff you don't need to lift heavy weights in terms of
2:17:52
your your own body is assuming at least 100 pounds that's pretty [ __ ] heavy when i do kettlebells i don't do
2:17:57
anything heavier than 70 pounds for the most part that's the heaviest [ __ ] i ever lived so it's mostly just
2:18:04
full body motion that makes your body know that this is a regular part of your
2:18:09
life so the normal deterioration that most people experience you can stave that off for the most part
2:18:16
and there's a real potential in the future with genetic editing and all kinds of
2:18:22
wacky shades they're experimenting on all sorts of stuff that could extend lifespans in a
2:18:28
radical way christopher chris chris there's crispr but there's a couple other things they're doing too like and
2:18:34
who knows what the [ __ ] they're doing in china yeah like what do you mean they could be doing anything because they
2:18:39
don't there's no restrictions by the same they don't disclose yeah they don't have to tell anybody
2:18:44
anything they can work like hand and fist with the government and nobody has to know nothing about
2:18:50
what's going on you know that's why they can develop all kinds of [ __ ] without like the
2:18:56
normal restrictions their government and their businesses are like that they're inexorably connected the
Conspiracy Corner With Joe Rogan
2:19:02
businesses don't get to make decisions that are bad for the government if they do they disappear dudes okay here let's
2:19:09
go conspiracy theory let's go how different how different okay
2:19:14
i see you miles
2:19:20
a conspiracy more than a high god okay here's the conspiracy uh are joe coy and chelsea handler
2:19:27
really in a relationship
2:19:41
it was alex jones was hitting me nonstop is there's something awry here seems like a false flank
2:20:00
what the [ __ ] did you say millions of crisis actors
2:20:06
that's corrected because you said middle ages and then you realize mid-life
2:20:15
[Laughter] okay but we love joe on this podcast you
2:20:21
know chelsea i love chelsea i like wrote a thing about one of her books or like wrote a little blurb oh really back in
2:20:26
the disney yeah she was from the comedy store she was always cool nah now back her show she was great
2:20:32
she was great her interviewing was great it was different what happened tone in this room just changed to [ __ ]
2:20:39
no i'll be honest yeah no i think she was [ __ ] great i'm not saying she's not i'm not saying she's
2:20:45
not but i'm just saying that there's like a general tone let's say something nice right now yep that's really really cold out the moment
2:20:52
yeah i love that okay oh you felt like i needed to justify you
2:20:57
no no you didn't you didn't believe that yeah i did that she's just talking she's like oh i wrote a blurb for her
Rogan Feels Reflects on Carlos Mencia
2:21:05
because we felt bad we felt like we were yeah we're not trashing anybody that's the thing it's like i don't like trash and fellow comedians i really don't i
2:21:11
genuinely genuinely don't no did that change after mencia you felt a little bit 100 percent really you felt
2:21:18
bad during the moment of it um uh i realized how much negativity it creates i was almost looking at like like if it
2:21:24
was a system right if you're looking at a system you're looking at like you input
2:21:29
x and you get back this and i'm like okay a good thing was done
2:21:35
where where people weren't in danger of having their intellectual property
2:21:40
taken by someone who's far more successful but the weird thing was the anger like
2:21:46
watching the anger like it's like you're throwing meat to a a
2:21:52
group of [ __ ] piranhas like there's just this buzzing of people joining on one side or the other side and i realize
2:21:59
like a lot of this is not logical and it's one of the problems with the way human beings interact with each other
2:22:04
that we just choose teams and it's like a normal natural inclination that we can't escape no
2:22:10
matter how logical you are like even if you're like a super logical person you're still
2:22:17
there's some part of you that has an inclination towards teams so how do you push yourself away from it just kind of
2:22:23
recognize what it is like know when it pops up and just go this is a dumb road but but is that
2:22:29
tough for you like like when you get [ __ ] on by one side specifically and then the other side is like yo you're
2:22:35
pretty cool how hard is it for you to just stay even it's okay
2:22:40
like i would [ __ ] on me for sure like really if i didn't know me yeah for what exactly some other comic i
2:22:47
would make fun of me totally what would you say oh i'd say terrible things about
2:22:53
steroid use insecurities being short i have a lot of great jokes about me really a lot of fun
2:23:00
so you don't even do when people make fun of you do you care well you can care but it's not going to
2:23:05
change the way they think like like it's not good if you hear it like if someone said it to my face like
2:23:10
that's mean yeah like why are you being mean to me man i don't even know you yeah people will say mean things to you
2:23:16
just to try to get a reaction out of you but those people are usually way more dangerous than the average person that
2:23:22
says something online the average person says something online it's like you're not even connected like
2:23:27
maybe you are it's like you're like you're you're trapped in a cave and there's like a tunnel that goes
2:23:33
up to the air and you're like [ __ ] you yeah you're not connected to that person you're not in front of them if someone
2:23:39
has mean to you in front of you that's a real problem yeah and weirdness is when it spills over when people get used to
2:23:46
communicating with people the way they do on the internet and they try to do it in real life and you see it all the time in world star videos
2:23:53
they just get [ __ ] up because they think they can talk [ __ ] but they talk [ __ ] on the internet they think they can
2:23:59
just get away with it like they don't have the same amount if you're if you're 24 and you lived in 1976 or if you're 24
2:24:07
and you live now you got a totally different type of interaction with people yeah these [ __ ] people are
2:24:13
interacting with people in a text form sixty percent of the time yeah so if
2:24:18
that's a part of your development and everybody agrees i i'll i agree that people who grow up in sort of like touch
2:24:25
and go environments they're a little slicker yeah right we call it street smarts people like if you don't have any
2:24:31
of that forget it it's over you're fine yeah and if all your dude is texting
2:24:36
you're not experiencing life you're trapped in your house you're trying to disconnect you're sitting on the couch
2:24:42
getting a [ __ ] neck cramp because you're [ __ ] texting yeah that's the people of today yeah that's
2:24:48
what's weird about it yeah you're not designed for that right so the human
2:24:53
brain has to find a way to catch up all right guys we'll take a break for a second because it's that [ __ ]
2:24:58
nba finals okay you know you're putting money down and why would you not want to win more money you're not going to win
2:25:03
more money than my boogie i mean it's very simple i'll tell you why you deposit 200
2:25:09
they're going to give you 300 to gamble with that's crazy you get to gamble with more money than you actually put down
2:25:15
that's how you win the most goddamn money and when you've got these nba finals okay it's time to put your money where

2:25:54
anything anytime anywhere with my bookie now let's get back to the show so let me tie this back to what we talked about
2:26:00
seeing all the hate etc what happened to mancio what would you do differently about nothing that's what i was thinking i wouldn't do
2:26:05
a thing different i took the hit but it's like the hit wasn't it wasn't bad because i was right and eventually i
2:26:10
knew they would realize i was right and i would wish that he would realize i was right and well i hate i also people
2:26:16
don't realize you took a hit i think a lot of people's history view is yes you call down in c and then you had the biggest podcast on
2:26:22
the planet that's true also yeah they don't know what you went through afterwards it wasn't bad it was not bad
2:26:28
bad things happen for comic standards i think it is well i got banned from the comedy store i mean that was a that was
2:26:34
a real problem yeah because it wasn't mitzi shore's idea the real problem was i was on the phone with mitzi uh like
2:26:42
more than an hour before they called me to tell me i was banned so i was on the phone with mitzi and i told her out of
2:26:48
respect what had happened i said mitzi i go we are [ __ ] tired of this guy stealing jokes she's like carlos
2:26:56
are you sure he's stealing i mean we have videos of it he's a [ __ ] thief and so we we had this conversation on
2:27:03
the phone and she goes well just keep away from them so i told her that we're going to release this video she goes
2:27:09
well just keep away from i go i'll do whatever you want me to do and she goes okay you want to go up tonight and i
2:27:15
said sure what time do you want to put me up she was all 10 30. i could thank you very much i
2:27:20
love you that's the last time i talked to her wow then i got a call an hour later and i
2:27:26
realized like she was in a state where uh bitsy shores like legitimately
2:27:33
if you looked at all of the people that are important in the development of comedy she's the number one most
2:27:40
important person that wasn't a comic number one
2:27:51
mom uh she's like she she uh started the comedy store with her
2:27:56
husband they got divorced she got the comedy store and she ran the comedy store in a way
2:28:01
where she was a strong lady and she had [ __ ] strong ideas about
2:28:08
what was good what was bad she would tell you right to your face she would tell you i [ __ ] hate that
2:28:14
[ __ ] did she ever say that to you [ __ ] yes what's she saying i had this bit about and nicole smith and her husband
2:28:20
she [ __ ] hated that bit because she jay howard marshall that dude who was like 50 years old yeah buy them
2:28:27
he was older than bite and he was biting his dad but but um she was
2:28:33
responsible for the environment of the comedy store where she just let the comedians
2:28:38
express themselves the best way that they could and and give them a home and and and set these
2:28:45
standards the comedy store prior yeah uh kennedy
2:28:50
bill hicks bill so many legends david letterman worked out there yeah eddie griffin you know damon wayans was there
2:28:57
a lot martin lawrence was there a lot it was like dice clay like so many people came out of that
2:29:02
place and it was chaos it didn't always work out perfectly but she designed it in a way
2:29:08
where she could create a place where these really [ __ ] up people could come and perform and she would call it her
2:29:14
island and misfit toys she knew what she was doing man
2:29:19
and you know you know she's a completely unusual person why
2:29:25
there's nobody very few people just dedicate themselves to a thing like that and like have this idea of like what's
2:29:30
the right way to do it and they're right she was right she's right so often yeah like someone
2:29:36
would call and complain about kenneth and she would i don't care should they give a [ __ ]
2:29:43
the place was packed every night she did not give a [ __ ] but how is she okay with mencia then because this is why she
2:29:48
didn't she didn't know and i also think she was having some legitimate health
2:29:54
problems and unfortunately yeah when i first met her she was already in 94 she
2:29:59
was already struggling a little and then as time went on it got worse and i don't think if people don't come to her and
2:30:06
complain i don't think she necessarily knows unless she's watching every single set
2:30:12
who came up with this bit first she doesn't know right so if you just
2:30:17
come down for one 20-minute set and you see someone kill and you go oh my god he's hilarious if
2:30:24
you had come 20 minutes before you might have saw paul mooney do his version of it right right and if that
2:30:30
was the case maybe then she would be able to go hey what the [ __ ] but
2:30:36
like i said then even in the 90s she was already struggling you know she had a i
2:30:41
think it was a neurological disorder and it it's hard for her so i don't blame
2:30:46
her but she had ideas that didn't necessarily work but you [ __ ] never know what's going to work how many people did we started out with that were
2:30:53
like open micros that you think about that i think about that knew you knew they were yeah and they just [ __ ]
2:31:00
they fell apart on re-entry yeah yeah yeah yeah think about that like the
2:31:05
first friend i knew that there was a comic that stopped and they were funny too uh-huh but they
2:31:11
just didn't want to go through it there's a girl that i dated when i was 21 as a girl i dated when we
2:31:17
were both open micros together she was funnier than me like she was so funny she was hilarious she was [ __ ]
2:31:24
hilarious and i remember thinking if i don't make it as a comedian at least i [ __ ] her
2:31:34
i mean this lady's the next roseanne like she's so good she was a killer and then what happened
2:31:41
i don't know stopped it i don't know i don't know i lost track i haven't experienced a lot of touch with her friends but i want to know her name yeah
2:31:48
i moved to new york and what i don't want to say it and uh when i moved to new york um i don't know
2:31:54
it just stopped yeah i mean back then you had so few opportunities and if you didn't get one i imagine it would just
2:32:00
wear you down because you're just toiling at that point yeah like this internet [ __ ] is so different it's so
2:32:05
different well i've been through both things yeah and uh the what what it
2:32:10
really makes me understand like more than anything is like how important it is to like share
2:32:17
share success and like get everybody out of that horrible period in the beginning where
2:32:23
you don't know if you're going to make it because the more people that you can get that are convinced that they could be professionals the more you're going
2:32:29
to get those dudes that we remember from the open mic days that didn't make it i think about that girl all the time
2:32:35
i think about her she was [ __ ] funny man she was funny she had a witty way of looking at things yeah and i'm like she
2:32:40
was 21 we were both 21. i'm like what would have happened to her when she was 29. what about when she's 33 she might
2:32:46
be a murderer right now she might be straightening up slaying on netflix yeah selling out arenas just walking out
2:32:53
there yeah yeah she was that good but for whatever reason
2:32:59
there's not there's no you know back then it was dog eat dog and everybody thought they were gonna be the host of the tonight show well there was two
2:33:05
shows yeah and then maybe you get a half hour and then there was the sitcom game yeah the sid comp game when uh tim allen
2:33:11
got his show and roseanne got her show and seinfeld and brett butler then the whole game became get a deal to do
2:33:18
yeah and craft of an act about this it seems like a pilot yeah like you would
2:33:24
he would do an act that was like a pilot for a sitcom and we all got intoxicated by the sitcom world yeah i don't know if
2:33:31
he did it on i mean i loved his show but ray romano's we seem like looking back it's like oh his whole comedy was ray
2:33:36
romano was my character on news radio and he got fired no wait really really
2:33:42
yes ray romano was the original handyman on news radio
2:33:47
and he got fired ray was a good friend of mine i love until this day he's a good friend of mine i love him great
2:33:52
he's brilliant and i i opened for ray at a bowling alley yeah i think it's
2:33:58
jimmy's comedy alley i think that's what it was called in queens like way back in the day and i remember sitting in the
2:34:03
audience with uh my friend watching ray romano just straight murder going god
2:34:10
damn he's good yeah he's so good yeah and then a year later we are in this
2:34:17
situation where uh i have a development deal with nbc to do my own show
2:34:23
but then there's this other show that they've already shot a pilot for but they're gonna fire this dude and
2:34:29
you know go and read for it he just didn't test him no idea i had no idea he never found out but here's the good thing they fired him and then hired
2:34:36
another guy to do the pilot so i was once removed so i felt like i said hey
2:34:49
well then you know like kevin james and i were good friends and he was good friends with ray too so we would call eat together and like this was right
2:34:56
when rey was creating everybody loved raymond yeah and he was like sitting there with like scripts and [ __ ] and
2:35:02
talking to us that [ __ ] was obsessed good like that show became amazing because that dude was dedicated
2:35:08
we're at jerry's famous deli eating reuben yeah yeah yeah and ray is just going to watch scratch
2:35:14
we're running jokes and [ __ ] i'm like damn this dude is fired up that's so amazing yeah the best stand-up comedic
2:35:22
actor i've ever seen like as a comedic actor and stand-up stand-up primarily he was a [ __ ] great comedic actor and
2:35:28
you know just as important really good dude yeah what you expect is what you get yeah
2:35:34
real solid real cool dude i was uh yeah yeah i was at the cellar once and uh
2:35:40
he's just like the calmest chillest guy right like not high energy nothing crazy
2:35:45
and uh we're sitting at the back table and we were talking about something and i was like uh yeah you know i'm from new
2:35:50
york but i went to school out in california and uh i go yeah i went to uc santa barbara and he goes he goes oh
2:35:56
yeah yeah yeah wild school wild school and i was like yeah there's a lot of parties he was like oh no no my son went
2:36:01
there during the school shooting and his son was at the school do you
2:36:07
remember when there was like a school shooting at ucsb no his son was at the school during that wow there's so many
2:36:13
school shootings now yeah yeah i can't remember i feel so involved why is that specific here have you thought
2:36:18
about it no alpha brain here in america yeah well i think the problem is that it
2:36:24
is a great way to get a lot of attention and to do the most horrific thing to a society that you feel like has abandoned
2:36:31
you if you want to if you hate the world
2:36:36
one of the worst things you could do is kill kids yeah so that's the scariest thing for all of us yeah when you have
2:36:42
children you'll have this feeling it's like the world becomes a completely different place and which is one of the things like i
2:36:48
was thinking one of the things that happened to me when i became a parent and also just as i became older and i
2:36:55
watched children grow and become older and wiser and figure things out i
2:37:00
realized we're all just babies that grew up and i used to meet a person i think oh
2:37:06
this guy's an idiot but now i look at someone i literally like i look at you and i think of you as a baby
2:37:13
and i think of you going through your life and getting to who you are now and it just instantaneously develops more
2:37:19
empathy for people instantaneously yeah it's like it's a paradigm shift like a like
2:37:24
the most profound psychedelic experience you could ever have yeah and it makes you realize that
2:37:31
this whole thing that we do with like teams or othering people or this not you all that stuff is just fear
2:37:40
it's a giant percentage of what we're doing when we're interacting with people poorly is just fear yeah we're fear we
2:37:47
were fearful that they're going to be cruel to us so we we want to be cruel first yeah and there's like chest
2:37:53
bumping most people just want to be loved i remember talking to my cousin who's a psychiatrist and then i just
2:37:59
started therapy like whatever and i was like oh are we basically all just uh our personality is just uh adding up all our
2:38:05
defense mechanisms he's like yeah that's basically you're just a bunch of defense mechanisms into a human being yeah
2:38:10
there's a lot of that because you're accustomed to in terms of your dna your
2:38:16
dna is accustomed to fighting off predators [ __ ] bears and big cats that's that's our past all
2:38:23
human beings we didn't get here instantaneously yeah we got here through a long bloody horrific process where a
2:38:30
lot of babies got eaten by wolves that's why the little red riding hood
2:38:36
all that [ __ ] was so cool that's why i was about wolves because wolves just eat people
2:38:42
do you know they stopped world war one because of wolves no do you know there's a ceasefire
2:38:48
there was a ceasefire between the russians and the germans because so many of them were getting killed by wolves
2:38:55
they decided to listen [ __ ] they decided to decided to get together and kill the
2:39:02
wolves and then go back to killing each other no yes i saw that that picture of them playing
2:39:08
soccer on christmas oh yeah yeah and now
2:39:13
because they were trapped they were trapped in a crazy world and the world's still crazy it's just
2:39:19
crazy with more information is it possible to indoctrinate people with like love for country more now you
2:39:26
think like neural link well that's the scary thing the only way
2:39:31
no that's the scary thing about the neural link right if you can control something that's going on in someone's brain yeah i don't need the news i don't
2:39:38
need influencers on joe rogan's if you can't control it but if it's something that can't be controlled well how do they prove that
2:39:45
i don't know would you let them do it to you well they're controlling things already if you look at the if you look
2:39:50
at the world like a system and you look at the amount of resources and money that's pumped into controlling specific
2:39:56
narratives it's they're already controlling things but they're doing it because we choose to opt into our phone yeah but you're not it's not negotiable
2:40:02
like what you're not going to stop using your phone no i'm going to keep using my phone but at least i can be like oh you're showing this because if i see an
2:40:08
ad for [ __ ] toaster ovens maybe we spoke about toaster ovens yesterday and now i see the ad but if you don't even
2:40:14
have to convince me at least there's one layer but if you're already in here and you make me think i want to vote that
2:40:19
way you don't think that that's a little bit but how are you doing that how are you making someone think that they're going to vote of service if you can make
2:40:25
my dad have memory again if you can make you know and anybody do anything you can make them think anything you want i
2:40:31
think there's a real problem with narratives right there's a real problem with pushing narratives and not
2:40:37
letting people really decide what's going on objectively but i don't
2:40:42
i don't know if any one person is ever going to have control of that i think there's like this wave thing
2:40:48
that happens back and forth it's like twitter comes and everything goes left and who knows that people abandon that
2:40:53
and go right yeah is this like this weird wild sort of uh
2:40:58
wrestling match of human beings trying to figure out what the [ __ ] to do yeah society is just a bunch of
2:41:04
overcorrections each way it seems like there's a lot of that yeah there's a lot of that yeah and a lot of that is done
2:41:11
unfortunately because of a lack of honesty if more people were honest and we we
2:41:16
we put like a lot of uh value and honesty and a lot of uh honor in it
2:41:22
that i think i think you could have like better conversations of course and then we would find out why people are
2:41:29
behaving the way they're behaving but right now there's like a lot of like i want my team to win so i'll [ __ ]
2:41:34
about stuff the problem with that is like my friend johnny who used to compliment people that he didn't even like like you got to
2:41:41
be able to do that yeah yeah that guy's a [ __ ] dick but you know what he is
2:41:46
this is what he does like he's an [ __ ] but his father is they make the best [ __ ] pizza i hate
2:41:52
the dude but i would go to his place he would tell you [ __ ] like that that was fun that's what i love about about
2:41:58
stand-up yeah is that like even the guys that were [ __ ] couldn't be denied as funny oh no like
2:42:04
no there was a guy do you ever know todd lin i think he's he's oh yeah he's you know he's pissed he is passed right yeah
2:42:11
yeah so todd lynn like was a [ __ ] hilarious i didn't know for certain but i know he had a baby arm he had a baby
2:42:18
he's been dead yo but i probably performed at one of his fundraisers i'm performing his fundraiser shout out
2:42:24
to todd lynn and his family i performed his fundraiser yeah mark the involvement he's hosting mark so far
2:42:29
and this is one of his good friends and mark is passing around the bucket that's how big of a dick todd lin was mark is passing around the bucket for people to
2:42:35
donate money he's like if he knew todd he wasn't necessarily the nicest guy as
2:42:40
he's asking for money but this [ __ ] was so goddamn funny really
2:42:45
bro oh he's a monster dude bro [ __ ] on me for bombing in front of him and then just crushed and he had a baby arm yeah
2:42:52
he had like a baby on like no no like you know yeah yeah and and he was still
2:42:58
talking that [ __ ] he was so funny but everybody's doing an [ __ ] and there's a lot of people like this like like patrice is the greatest i've ever seen
Rogan on Patrice O’Neal & Joey Diaz
2:43:03
my favorite but a lot of people would be like yo patrice was kind of an [ __ ] but you couldn't deny him patrice was an
2:43:09
[ __ ] to everybody that's yeah that's fast he was always nice to me yeah because he thought you were a real one bro he's nice patrice was nice he was
2:43:16
just you had to be don't [ __ ] a joke you had to be able to take a joke yeah
2:43:23
what do you say joe oh he was always funny always he was just always funny about everything he patrice had a way of
2:43:29
looking at things where we would all talk and they would wait for patrice's point
2:43:34
he's one of those guys if you talked to patrice and hung out with him i hung out with him in vegas once we
2:43:40
were all at the backstage at one of those opium anthony shows he was just such a i remember hanging
2:43:46
out with him going man i wish i lived closer to him yep who's that guy you know yeah but luckily
2:43:51
i had joey diaz joey joey's your guys coach patrice yeah yeah
2:43:56
he was very much like that joey diaz was very much like that like we would all line up the back of the room when joey
2:44:02
diaz was lighted on fire yeah and all the people i've ever seen kill i'd never seen anybody hit joey diaz
2:44:08
rpms he would hit he would have these bits that they were so funny that you you
2:44:14
couldn't he could say things you weren't allowed to say yeah because he was like a human cartoon he did he weren't even
2:44:20
sure if he was real yeah yeah this guy white is in spain his timing was [ __ ] perfect and he
2:44:27
would nail punch lines and turn beat red and people would be falling out of their seats yeah
2:44:32
as multiple times i've been in that original room where i'll go god i wish we were filming this yeah i wish we were
2:44:38
filming this because i don't think i don't think anybody's going to understand if they're not here right now you know you know fahim just put out his
2:44:44
special yes and uh shout out to uh go check out uh hat trick but that's uh
2:44:50
that idea for the special that's what i wanted to see i wanted to see joey do that too and because joey for me i was
2:44:56
like you have to understand him within the space of the store yeah like i don't know there's something magical about it
2:45:02
and i didn't understand until i went out there and i saw him for the first time you had been telling me a lot about him and i remember just sitting and watching
2:45:08
and it was uh yeah it was special man i'm working with joey in atlantic city this weekend for
2:45:13
the first time in years i haven't been on stage with him in like two years i got to watch him yeah yeah i do i told

2:45:44
comedy store community joey diaz was just pure chaos who just you would drop them in and like
2:45:52
during like the the drug joey days like during the early days when he was like a straight-up criminal he reminded me so
2:45:58
much of my friend johnny so much johnny who's the pool hustler
2:46:03
yeah yeah joey was like just like him yeah like a wild dude from the streets but like a good dude yeah like i knew he
2:46:09

2:46:20
you know way thinner and like
2:46:25
yeah yeah he was wearing a leather jacket built like a football player
2:46:31
and all those nbc studio executives would get mad because he was eating all of their
2:46:46
i would laugh too
2:47:01
this is like 1996. yeah you know we were both like you know i was probably 28 and joey's like a little older than me where
2:47:07
and joey just got to la straight from prison he was gay oh he's in and out of jail i
2:47:13
think he was like running from something in seattle he had to come back to l.a like there's a warrant out for him
2:47:19
he couldn't get uh a passport to go places because all the crap he he kidnapped a drug dealer with a machine
2:47:25

2:47:31

2:47:37
you are i know what you are you're a great guy who just had a crazy life you collect these guys these these
2:47:44
guys are valuable they're everything they're life man the those are sam kennison's those are the
2:47:50
richard pryors but why do you think because they just they don't fit in and that's how you see what it is for real
2:47:56
like if you're not a part of it you see what it is for real because you don't have to operate you're not based
2:48:03
found his mother dead on the floor when he was on acid no that's what he was like 14 years old yeah yeah well yeah
2:48:10
when you're a part of the community your [ __ ] your goosebumps just stand up you're
2:48:16
like what yeah so it's like those type of people from
2:48:21
that angst and that unusual view of the world have to find themselves
2:48:27
yes and sometimes themselves is a little outside of the enormous outside of the group they find it through the most potent form of entertainment yeah all of
2:48:34
our great rock stars all of our great comics all
2:48:39
of our great hip-hop artists all of them come from crazy backgrounds
2:48:45
not all of them obviously that's a big generalization but i'm trying to make my point
2:48:50
no i understand what you're saying i think they don't get joey diaz in a suburb yeah yeah but more it's like
2:48:57
there's a there's a freedom to being outside if you're willing to harness yes and the freedom is you get
2:49:02
to actually find who you are well the reality is there's no real outside like people feel like they're outside but so
2:49:09
many people feel like they're outside there's a lot of people and when you go to a comedy club all the other people also feel like they don't
2:49:15
get it they laugh at your point they go yes yes yes yeah yeah yeah and even if even it's
2:49:22
what you're saying is wrong but it's funny it's like that's where it's like we're
2:49:27
[ __ ] with the wiring one of my favorite bits that you do is that bit do you do about countries where they treat
2:49:34
their women they got the best food boys
2:49:43
that is so good cause like you look if you were a terrible person you wanted to misrepresent who you are yeah you would
2:49:50
write that oh this is just saying that women belong in the kitchen yeah yeah that's not what they're saying no
2:49:57
it's not what you say you're saying something funny it's a funny thing to say i was trying to i did this talk like
2:50:02
gnome from a comedy seller do you know no yeah you would love gnome like okay good i worked his club way way way
2:50:08
back i know but he's like he's an interesting guy no andrew should connect you with no one i can get you audition at the comedy
2:50:14
cellar
2:50:20
shout out to all these uh comedy club owners without them he had a he had an interesting conversation he had this
2:50:26
like talk where there were these like intellectual dudes this guy named glenn lowry do you know yeah yeah so him and a
2:50:31
few other dudes and uh and they had some comics on stage and we're just talking about you know random things and comedy and political
2:50:38
correctness and culture etc and uh and there was like just it was just like
2:50:43
a moment on stage where i was talking like we should never be together like we don't have to have these conversations because you guys say what's right and we
2:50:49
say what's funny and i think what happens is the people that say what's right expect the people to say it's
2:50:54
funny to be right and that's where our jokes become more than jokes and where we get in
2:51:00
trouble if we're just out here just making jokes and talking [ __ ] and just being funny with no stakes that's wha
2:51:05
and then people look at us and they're like oh no these are the next intellectuals they are going to tell us how to think that's when we can't make
2:51:11
the craziest jokes well one of the arguments is that like if you say crazy things in the name of being funny then
2:51:17
other people that are not as smart as you will say those things and they'll be hurtful they'll feel like they have
2:51:24
license to say those things maybe i had a drag queen tell me that after show maybe
2:51:29
it was very intimidating mm-hmm she's wearing kiss boots uh but it's one of those things like i
2:51:35
don't know if you're responsible for the dumbest people in your arm you're not i don't know how that works you're not i
2:51:41
feel like at a certain point in time we have to agree that we most people love comedy if you
2:51:47
don't love comedy you have to opt out of this conversation so if you love comedy you must agree that a lot of what people
2:51:54
say they don't mean they just think it's a funny thing to say like this isn't just like quentin tarantino is not
2:52:00
really killing women when he's making once upon a time at home there's no dead women involved in the
2:52:05
production of that movie correct the violent movies violent rap eminem getting all those things let's just move toward comedy it'll move on but it's
2:52:12
also like it's the problem is it seems like you're just talking mm-hmm it seems like it's not like something you've
2:52:18
created that you've manipulated language in order to get a surprise result that makes people go
2:52:24
yeah and it seems like your statements because they sound just like everybody else when they talk
2:52:31
yes but i also think it's because that's how we feel and we can have wrong
2:52:36
feelings and i think that's the biggest difference what's wrong though if you feel it
2:52:41
like you don't have somebody might cut you off in traffic and you might think the worst possible thing for that car and then three seconds later you go ah
2:52:48
it was just upset at the moment there's i mean don't don't people like get out of don't people like oh yeah they don't
2:52:53
get life in jail for murdering somebody because they had moments of rage you know what that's from temporary temporary insanity you know you know
2:52:59
what that's right that's what comedy is temporary and standard if this is my crazy thought in the moment and then i'm gonna say it again and it's gonna be
2:53:05
funny but i don't feel that way anymore simple as that what are you saying
2:53:11
comedy is temporary my funniest moment my funniest thought and my knee-jerk reaction to something
2:53:17
and i'm going to craft it and add words and add ideas and wrap myself around it no
2:53:22
marijuana
2:53:30
yo the joke about the woman food thing i don't think you should i don't think you should actually say he was a wrong
2:53:36
position he said it was insufferable no that's a great word throw people off your trail
2:53:43
it's like it's like covering your your tracks with leaves it's crappy that's crappy
2:53:48
that's wrong it's good it's shitty it's a solid word if you're trying to be deceptive
2:53:53
you know trying to infuse obfuscate whatever escape somebody somebody got a high score on
2:53:59
his s8 let's go bro yeah yeah yeah [ __ ] it yeah [ __ ] it dude let's just make the
2:54:06
jokes who gives a [ __ ] what anybody says about it they want to write think pieces who gives a [ __ ] well the thing is it's
2:54:11
like they represent a valid group of humans who have their opinions but the problem is if they try
2:54:19
to impose those opinions on people who have different opinions so there's some people who love [ __ ] talking comedy yes
2:54:25
that's what we do yes all right if you want to pretend that everything i have to say i always mean i'm checking out
2:54:31
i'm not interested in doing that yeah i want to talk the same way i talk around my friends yeah i want to talk the same
2:54:37
way talk around comics yeah we know we're all having fun and talking [ __ ] and i want to do that to the moment they
2:54:44
say ladies and gentlemen joe rogan hey what's up i want to talk to those people i got to talk to my best friends i want
2:54:50
to develop bits that are as funny as i can make them and i don't mean all the things i'm saying but i'm gonna i'm
2:54:56
gonna hit you with the best [ __ ] i have funny is in the outcast whether that's like the person on a tv show that's
2:55:01
weird or the thought that's a thought that should get you out catching it on stage like innocent yeah he's the
2:55:06
ultimate outcast yeah right wearing a brain a trench coat yelling at you screaming used to be a
2:55:13
preacher what the [ __ ] happened to this guy ultimate outcast right what what [ __ ] class of people did he does he
2:55:19
fit into he's out of the christians he's gone like where's he fitting in hollywood he's like five foot four he's
2:55:26
fat as [ __ ] he's wears a beret yeah he's got a trench coat on but when that dude would get on stage you'd be like whoa
2:55:32
what is this a new kind of comedy what the [ __ ] is going on yeah and all the people that have ever like like
2:55:38
completely ignited a completely different style of comedy he's my number one really yeah man because out of
2:55:45
nowhere he's doing this wild screaming yelling like passionate preacher comedy
2:55:52
yeah he was doing a [ __ ] tent revival preacher comedy right that's what he did
2:55:57
he was one of rob's favorites which kind of makes sense dude because they're both essentially preaching
2:56:02
yes yes but barack he's one of rock's favorites because rock song in like the 86 88 era
2:56:12
i saw him in 88 i got the psalm 88 was he was on the slide and this is
2:56:19
as a lifelong die-hard sam kittison fan i'm not saying this in any disrespect i
2:56:24
think he's one of the greatest of all time but i think you have to judge comics as like the the highest rpms that they
2:56:31
achieve just the same way you have to judge fighters like people say who's one of the greatest heavyweights of all time in
2:56:36
boxing i say mike tyson because mike tyson during his day was a [ __ ] destroyer yeah and maybe it only lasted
2:56:42
a few years but he's the guy who comes to mind for me because i grew up during the era where mike tyson was the
2:56:47
executioner so i feel like that about almost everything like almost everything
2:56:52
has to be judged by the like the errors in which it happens
2:56:57
don't you think that that's the case yeah and for my money sam kennison during that era
2:57:04
was just a [ __ ] new thing nobody had seen anything like that
2:57:09
there's this guy with a [ __ ] trench coat and a beret and he's screaming about going to hell
2:57:15
and how satan's going to be like you've been married oh it's normal to you we'll show you the place where you torture
2:57:20
souls yeah like he had this thing where he would scream at the audience yeah
2:57:26
i've been married twice how would be like club men
2:57:31
he was this fat guy screaming hell would be like club men i've been married twice
2:57:37
yeah yeah it was like no one had seen anything like it yeah and he had like knowledge of the bible that's a yeah he
2:57:43
would do like biblical knowledge in the middle of bits like if bill hicks was funny oh my god shut your mouth that's
2:57:50
not delicious murder really murder i saw billy
2:57:56
you don't like bill hicks i hate that guy really i hate maybe i hate his fans but like people are still walking around
2:58:02
like bill hicks was the great it's like i'll tell you what pretend you like listen to me there was a [ __ ] green room at the
2:58:08
punch line atlanta and it had uh someone everyone graffitied all over the walls and in one part it said quit trying to
2:58:14
be hicks yeah he's true because he made you feel like you were doing something stupid you
2:58:22
you were so jealous of him and so i got i was lucky i got a chance to see him when i was an open miker so i was just
2:58:29
starting out and i saw him twice and one time he murdered and one time he boom
2:58:34
i mean it was amazing it was amazing and me and greg fitzsimmons and a couple other comics i don't think are doing it
2:58:40
anymore we're on the back of nick's comedy stop and he went on after a dude who was a very
2:58:46
regionally funny middle-act very you know obvious premises but did a good job yeah had a
2:58:54
good set and bill hicks ate [ __ ] he ate [ __ ] for the the majority of a
2:58:59
set and people were just getting up and leaving getting up and leaving and while he was doing this bit about
2:59:06
it was some bit about someone taking a [ __ ] so he's in the middle middle of taking a [ __ ] i forget
2:59:13
exactly i don't want to butcher it in the middle of taking a [ __ ] he's like he looks up he goes this usually clears
2:59:19
a room and people are like leaving in droves it's like a 300 person room by the end
2:59:24
of it there's maybe 50 people and maybe 10 comedians were [ __ ] crying laughing yeah and he never
2:59:30
looked phased he never looked phased and we were howling and we were wearing howland ironically we were howling
2:59:37
because this [ __ ] was funny it was just so dark yeah it was so crazy
2:59:42
it was it was like some of his stuff was so funny it was just it was different than any other kind of
2:59:48
comedy so it was like comedy from a dude who recently did mushrooms and was reevaluating everything and that was
2:59:55
like pretty much what was actually going on with bill yeah and then he quit doing drugs and he just dedicated himself to
3:00:02
like getting like messages out in comedy and the problem is back then no one had a [ __ ] podcast man so you had to be
3:00:09
funny and if you had something you felt like people need to know about it you had to feed you got to figure out how to
3:00:14
put that into comedy it's too complicated yeah it makes people preachy that's okay
3:00:20
yeah so i do i do but doesn't that happen to comics as they get better as they get more famous as they get more
3:00:26
successful they become more preachy watch louis ck he's not preachy
3:00:31
yeah louis is uh dave chappelle is not preaching dave chappelle is expressive he wants you to know
3:00:38
exactly how he feels about things but he's the biggest comic alive he's not preachy
3:00:44
yeah i think a [ __ ] i hate that noise what do you think he's trying to express
3:00:49
himself in the most honest and and and compassionate way possible he's a
3:00:55
beautiful person he's one of the nicest people i've ever met in my life like genuinely always nice yeah ver rarely
3:01:02
angry at any even if he's mad at someone's trying to ruin his career he'll have a joke or two about it and they'd be like
3:01:08
and they never saw everyone's laughing have you seen jamie foxx's it's so good it's so good so good we talked about
3:01:14
this is jamie the most talented entertainer maybe ever maybe maybe ever
3:01:20
maybe ever yeah impressions yeah singing he can play the piano yes wait i didn't know dude
3:01:28
jamie foxx can do anything he's one of those people that can literally do anything yeah here's the image you want
3:01:33
to run it back yeah run it back because it's so preposterous i ran up on stage i was incensed i was in sense
3:01:41
come on thank you for james but jamie foxx you're never in trouble you're ever in trouble jamie foxx will show up on
3:01:47
the sheriff head and all the other comedians just stood there they're waiting on me to die
3:01:53
like take over even the physicality on everything yeah i see you chris rock
3:01:59
that's if you blindfolded me i'd go oh that's dave chappelle are you talking yeah yeah not stupid yeah dave's just
3:02:06
that yeah it's so good that's so good it's preposterous yeah i want the jamie foxx
3:02:11
documentary he's just done everything like his life is so fascinating you know what i think his work speaks for itself
3:02:17
what do you mean i mean i don't want to i don't need a documentary that dude i need that dude
3:02:23
[Music] i don't want to interrupt keep going do whatever the [ __ ] you want to do i want to see how he plays mike tyson he's
3:02:29
gonna play mike tyson oh that's crazy i bet it's gonna be phenomenal he does an amazing mike tyson impression yeah and
3:02:35
he also is of that age who grew up during the time when mike tyson was the dominator yeah so he knows what that
3:02:42
really was like it's like you're not recreating that we we experienced that yeah you know why do you mike tyson
3:02:48
fought bruce selden the bruce selden looked like a comic book superhero and
3:02:53
you could see the fear in his eyes when he fought mike tyson you just mike tyson is just looking at
3:02:59
you like there is not a chance in the world that you're gonna survive oh hells yeah we gotta go oh dove what do we got
3:03:06
what a legendary again it looks like a lot of fun if you hate your body
3:03:18
i love it don't get me wrong i wish i could have something no i would if i was hungry i didn't have
3:03:23
dinner dinner reservations [ __ ] eat the [ __ ] out of that pizza joe we gotta wrap this up bro
3:03:29
please let us uh it's an honor to be here in the new studio thank you so much for all you thank you man my pleasure
3:03:35
people people need to know you're a great guy they know you great but i don't think they know how great you
3:03:41
are i think it's very very rare that people in your position are this benevolent and i think that you set a tone that the
3:03:48
rest of us try to follow well that's so nice of you but i think it's good for everybody i know you think it's good for
3:03:53
everybody but i think that like if the guy on top is doing it and you don't do it you're a piece of [ __ ]
3:03:58
right and i think that most people on top don't do it and that's how they get to the top and i think that's what was so profound
3:04:05
about what happened with you is that everybody underneath you was like no i got to look out for my boys i got to put them on four and build their thing
3:04:12
exactly yeah they all took the same sort of strategy yes yes it was just the right path it was
3:04:18
just like i saw that path you know it was just it was just the right path it's not like a big deal in terms of um
3:04:26
what it really is is what we should have been doing all along but we were all like scratching clawing to try to get
3:04:31
hollywood gigs you know and i think once the internet came along it gave comedians this completely new network
3:04:39
of uh everybody became an asset not just like a competitor but
3:04:45
competitor is good like if you train at a jiu jitsu gym you want to train at a
3:04:50
place that has black belts because you want to be able to get to a really high level and you want to know if your stuff
3:04:55
is [ __ ] right so if you pull something off and you can pull it off on a purple belt but the black belt keeps [ __ ] it up that
3:05:02
might be [ __ ] yeah and you don't find that out like the same way with comedy comedy doesn't exist in a vacuum
3:05:07
yeah if you go to a place that doesn't have a comedy community you never find the best comic in the world they just
3:05:13
it's i don't say never but it's super rare if that's ever happened i don't think it ever has it's a [ __ ] new art
3:05:19
form right we we are really clearly indebted to each other yeah and the only way to recognize that is to uh reach out
3:05:26
to each other and to say it and and and to just like express i try to express it
3:05:32
all the time when i'm in my green room before my shows i'm like we are so lucky we're so lucky we could do this this is
3:05:38
the craziest thing in the world beautiful gratitude is it sounds like wooden beads and crystals but it's
3:05:44
[ __ ] real yeah that shit's real like gratitude is real so you're putting an energy out there that makes people feel
3:05:50
good and it makes people want to do the same yeah i agree with you
3:05:55
that is something we realize that and tell you yeah yeah i think that you made people
3:06:01
i think you guilted people into liking something like i think you were doing it so somebody else didn't do it that was
3:06:08
under you that maybe put you put them on or somebody else was trying to emulate you they're going all right well joe's doing it i got to also do this and then
3:06:14
when somebody starts to do it it's like the the altruism kick in there's a dopamine release for altruism you help someone else you start to feel good and
3:06:21
then you do that and you're like oh my god i really enjoy doing this that's the thing that people need to realize like
3:06:26
being nice is great feels good feels good to everybody when you make people feel good you feel good too yeah
3:06:32
you know it's good for all parties involved it's not a selfish uh you know one-way endeavor if someone
3:06:39
gets success it should be good for you too you should be happy for them and then they're happy er like you're happy
3:06:45
and everyone's happy and we can all like sort of like go through this weird thing together
3:06:50
because we don't know what this is you know every day you wake up and you try to pretend like all of it makes sense
3:06:56
but you [ __ ] shut your brain off every night and you go black for like eight hours leave gone into another
3:07:02
dimension and then you wake up in the morning and pretend that any of that [ __ ] makes any sense
3:07:08
yeah we're so accustomed to going unconscious
3:07:13
yeah literally having dreams having i had a dream that i was spearfishing in a [ __ ] tunnel that was in in a cave
3:07:21
where there was a mayan artifact what the [ __ ] is that what is that but it was vivid in the
3:07:27
dream it was vivid it was like i could see the paint and the gold and red paint
3:07:32
on these artifacts i was like this is wild we're in a cave system spearfishing wake up nope back in texas then just go
3:07:39

3:08:36
guy that was allegedly according to him he back engineered
3:08:41

and explaining like what what they were trying but grudgingly by the way begrudge and that's what kind of
3:09:42
convinced me he was like i i don't care to argue about this or debate about this like if if you don't believe me it's
3:09:48
fine i don't need to be here because i don't even care yeah remember he kept saying that yeah and then he was like this is what i experienced and i care a
3:09:55
little bit you dedicate your whole life to this no he didn't dedicate his life like he was an engineer he was only there for a short period of time and he
3:10:01
here's the word gets wild wanna hear the whole story yeah he had top secret clearance because he has to work on
3:10:07
these crafts allegedly according to him but because of that they had to tap into his phones they had to monitor all of
3:10:13
his discussions like if he's selling information to the russians okay so during that time period his wife is
3:10:19
having an affair and they they kill his top secret clearance and
3:10:25
suspend him during this time period and with no explanation because they think he'll be emotionally unsafe unstable and
3:10:32
you can't have a guy like that working on [ __ ] ufos so they don't tell him though they don't tell him his wife is
3:10:38
cheating on him so he's trying to figure out what the [ __ ] is going on and he brings friends out into the mountains to
3:10:44
view the launches of these ufos because they're on a very specific schedule and he knows the schedule so he takes these
3:10:50
people out deep into the nevada desert which is now the area though he took
3:10:55
people to you can't even go there anymore it's now off limits but at the time you can go there and he was
3:11:00
watching with his friends they were filming these [ __ ] things flying around in like these preposterous ways
3:11:06
that no airplane could fly did you see any of the videos i've seen it but you don't know what you're looking at yeah like you're looking at lights like it
3:11:12
could be anything that was the elon thing yeah yeah elon said some [ __ ] like why don't they have uh you know better
3:11:17
camera footage available yeah but they do he's not totally correct the fleer footage that they have from the david
3:11:24
fravor the commander david favor had one of the most impactful ufo video
3:11:29
encounters that that's ever happened it was off the coast of san diego and they they found this thing that moved from 50 000
3:11:36
feet above sea level to 50 in less than a second they don't know what it is they have no
3:11:42
idea what it was but it was actively monitoring them because it blocked all of their tracking devices which is
3:11:48
technically an act of war and then just [ __ ] just took off gone and went back to
3:11:55
their cat point which is the place where they had like they had like a designated spot where they're supposed to meet up
3:12:00
during this mission because what they're doing with this mission is there's a training mission and they had to dedicate and that [ __ ] ufo went to
3:12:07
that spot it's like i know where you're going [ __ ] and then took off again and gone and then when they relayed this to the
3:12:13
nimitz he was explaining how the people that were working there were like we see these things like every couple of weeks
3:12:18
we have no idea what the [ __ ] it is we don't know so you're 100 convinced ufos i'm not because it could be a drone that
3:12:25
they don't tell those people about it could be something that the government's working on um
3:12:32
likely us see the thing about communism is like it like the way they do it over there is
3:12:37
like slash communism capitalism maybe that works but a lot of what they do is they steal they steal a lot of
3:12:43
intellectual property from the united states it's one of the problems there's not a problem with united states stealing intellectual property from
3:12:48
china as far as i know it doesn't make the news but they banned huawei the reason why they banned huawei a cell
3:12:54
phone company right the company that makes they make modems as well they make many things but they found like enough
3:13:00
of an indication that they were suspicious there's some back doors in order to get data so if you're using
3:13:05
like huawei devices and you have some like super secure network that's developing nuclear weapons or whatever
3:13:11
the [ __ ] you're doing they would get all that data and there's so there's like hey chill the [ __ ]
3:13:17
you know we're in this weird time where we're only like a decade or so away from
3:13:23
nothing being a secret ever what do you mean there will be no more secrets you'll be able to read minds
3:13:29
you're coming to a place where language is probably going to be universal and
3:13:34
you're going to be able to communicate with people that are nowhere near you using the power of your thought this is
3:13:40
the neural link this is many of these technologies they're developing if you got to think about where it's going to go that's where it's
3:13:47
going to go that's one guy i talked to you said that's the end point of ai that's where it's all headed we're all
3:13:52
in one consciousness well it might be you gave me a broken glass you [ __ ] i almost caught myself what a dog wow
3:13:58
wow if you um please the russians please it was too much
3:14:04
it's no big deal you drink out of this scent i drank out of that end yeah
3:14:10
um what were we just talking about the russians group consciousness unconsciousness and singularity
3:14:15
what they're looking for don't worry about it don't worry about all that
3:14:21
you're half of it missed it's a problem bro it's just water and your fingers and
3:14:26
[Music] yeah you know i want to state for the record that most of this podcast is nonsense yeah uh i would say a hundred
3:14:33
percent yeah that's a hundred percent we like to be safe and just go 100
3:14:39
i stand by none of my claims no we're this is all scripted this is a scripted podcast and this is for you it's a
3:14:45
parody exactly okay but the with the five dudes drunk
3:14:51
with the ufo [ __ ] right before
3:14:56
they're out there they're out there bro say you believe it no the thing is i don't believe it because i i don't know
3:15:03
for sure but if i had a guess i would have to say most likely they're out there because there's not enough options
3:15:10
like if you had to think that this is the most unique circumstance ever in the history of the universe
3:15:15
the problem with that is the universe is too big yeah so it's so big that everything that's ever existed including
3:15:20
everything that's ever happened on earth in the exact same order has happened an
3:15:25
infinite number of times but you have to understand what infinity means it's too big for anybody to understand so are
3:15:33
there aliens of course there's not just aliens out there you're out there you're you're not just out there once you're
3:15:39
out there an impossible number of times and you're doing life all kinds of different ways
3:15:45
the number of people that live exactly the same as you have with every pause
3:15:52
every mistake every success all of it is exactly the same it's infinite that's
3:15:57
how big the universe is then there's also one that's the opposite yes failures disgrace everything falling apart murder
3:16:04
suicide all of it probably every single iteration of human beings vegan you out there joe
3:16:11
and that [ __ ] that's the way you cross the line
3:16:16
yeah i just wonder man if you watch the moose stomp a person at death you think you could eat that moose
3:16:23
i tell i'll suck the moose's dick and i'm good i don't know what you don't understand about me i'm apex predator
3:16:29
this mouth mouth is a predator dog take some mushrooms out guys
3:16:37
you uh you need something like a massage or something something
3:16:42
therapeutic like yoga class i don't know what to tell you bro it's this married life joe is this married life
3:16:49
well listen and this [ __ ] listen we love you bro we appreciate you i appreciate you guys and
3:16:55
i'm very very happy that there's so many uh of us out there you know this is an interesting time because none of us
3:17:01
would have ever had a show like this yeah or like any of the shows that we do if it was up to gatekeepers that's true
3:17:07
it wouldn't happen yeah they would have never said yes they would have never left you alone
3:17:13
like some of the [ __ ] that you say you know like dude never let you alone 100 there's no way and the only way to
3:17:19
do this is do it this way yes you got to just kind of and we are very grateful uh for you because of this well listen i'm
3:17:26
grateful that it exists and you know i i just remember sal's comedy corner yeah or something like that connie cole over
3:17:32
there yeah yeah that's when i knew something was happening with you but me like you were doing shows there right like you would
3:17:38
have like a live show or something there there was this little place off melrose or something like that right and like
3:17:44
this is no no this is like live uh like stand-up but like this is when you were maybe not working the store or something i was banned from the stand from the
3:17:50
store but you were like selling out these shows because of the podcast and i heard that and i was like
3:17:55
wait a minute like something is going on here there are people who can't sell out shows at comedy clubs and they're giving away tickets and this guy's doing a
3:18:02
comedy show and it was a restaurant slash comedy club and i don't think i got a podcast back then are you sure
3:18:08
yeah because the podcast was 2009 and maybe that was 2009 maybe
3:18:14
but uh i was banned from the store in 2007. i i thought it was off i thought it was off podcast because i was like
3:18:20
there's something happening with community here you're a whole new [ __ ] lighting no no i really thought it was all fun
3:18:26
it might be it might be right you might be right i'm not gonna thank god i don't know the timeline but the more
3:18:32
i'm thinking about i'm like it might be right it's it's hard to say it's like but that time era like sal's comedy hole
3:18:37
was a good one the ice house was a big one that was our real like safety wrap such a fun club dude great club yeah
3:18:43
great club is that back open again i don't know i haven't been in las vegas the ice house the ice house was our spot
3:18:49
in the haha we did the haha a lot and did they improv a lot you know anyway i just remember that happening
3:18:54
and i remember seeing like oh [ __ ] like you could create your own community and people want this they want this distraction they want the comedy they
3:19:00
want the conversation and i don't have to do these shows on mtv or whatever [ __ ] networks i was working on i
3:19:05
remember seeing that and i was like okay yeah yeah something's happening right here well you creek you you do create your own community but
3:19:12
what you do is just find other people that are doing the same stuff that you're doing yeah and just like
3:19:18
everybody like everybody's creating their own community you just like have you you join yeah you join together it's
3:19:25
like you know when no one person really does it and if it's your responsibility if you're the person that said like
3:19:31
you're further along in your career or further along and the weirdness of the path and in terms of like the amount of
3:19:36
people that are following you you it's your it's your obligation you have to bring everybody along like hey hey yeah we
3:19:42
don't need that anymore those sitcoms are ruining your horrible jokes yeah you can't tell terrible jokes if you
3:19:50
want to get a sitcom because there's a bunch of [ __ ] trolls out there that get you fired yeah yeah and they'll take away your livelihood right okay then
3:19:56
before you leave like what is your what are you looking at you what is your that's it
Wrap Up
3:20:03
what is your recommendation for how do we do for new york what you did
3:20:08
for la and then all kind of you're doing it already man you're already doing it what you're doing here is perfect this is a perfect
3:20:15
example a perfect like expression of you and a view and have you got everybody
3:20:21
that works here it's like you're doing it and you're doing it with your stand up you're doing it with your specials just keep doing it and it'll get better
3:20:28
and you'll find you know like smoother ways to do it you're going to continue
3:20:33
this weird path that we're all on like i feel like i get better at doing podcasts every day i feel like every time i do it
3:20:39
i get a little bit better and i know that sounds crazy but i just think that we can define ourselves in uh like a
3:20:45
confining way for no reason we decide well about as good as i ever gonna get at this but that's not really true like
3:20:52
you can get better and i still [ __ ] up like sometimes i'll talk over someone i'm like [ __ ] like i didn't want to i just it
3:20:58
just blurted out i'm like control settle down like try to figure out how to get the most out of this person yeah and it
3:21:04
just gets better all the time and it's like everything else you do it's the amount of energy you put into it the
3:21:11
amount of focus you put into it and if you put a lot into it you can get better at it as long as you're alive
3:21:17
as long as you're live and you're healthy put a lot into it yeah joe rogan

3:22:26

3:22:32
when we're fun can't's a weird word when you're not supposed to say things
3:22:39
yeah yeah yeah you can't you can't do that
3:22:44

3:22:57

3:23:02
them are a mess what do you mean there's no amazing examples of people who want to tell you
3:23:08
what you can't say there's no examples when you look at that person you go they're kind and compassionate and
3:23:13
they're charitable and they're beautiful they always look at the bright side of things there's no examples they're just
