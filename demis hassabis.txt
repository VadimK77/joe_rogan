0:00
you know when you have a rock star in the room when you see the room filled and busy and excited and definitely
0:07
Dennis is a rock star as you all know I made a few talking points it's always a
0:13
lesson in humility when reading a CV likes of one of them is he started he
0:18
was a child prodigy in Chess at age four he started by age 13 he was at a master
0:24
standard okay so that's a good start in life I guess he completed a levels and
0:30
scholarship level exams two years early age 15 and 16. that's in the British
0:35
system but it's also telling and Cambridge told him you're too young to
0:41
come to Cambridge go do some video gaming okay now that's you can see how forward-looking Cambridge is I'm not
0:48
sure I'm not sure Cambridge told them is to go into video gaming but anyway he took a sabbatical before starting to
0:55
study that's another message please remember so he in the video gaming company bullfrog
1:01
Productions then he went to Queen's College Cambridge completed computer science triples and graduated
1:09
1997 with a double first another specialty from Dennis and University of
1:15
Cambridge Zen okay you would expect you would have stayed there you know worked with you
1:21
know some uh uh fundamental scientists but no he went back into video gaming
1:27
okay now that's that's a carrier you know that I'm sort of thinking why did I do only one thing with my life uh so and
1:36
not only did you go back to video gaming he founded a video gaming company at xcr
1:41
Studios and then he actually returned to Academia to obtain a PhD in cognitive
1:48
neuroscience at UCL one of the top plays for neurosciences in the world
1:53
supervised by enero Maguire and he was trying to find inspiration in
2:01
the human brain for new AI algorithms I think this is extremely interesting because there is still something to be
2:07
learned from the human brain and he wrote a landmark paper it's the first one he wrote which established a link
2:14
between the constructive process of imagination and the reconstructive process of episodic memory Recall now
2:21
this is very interesting because the process of imagination is I think what chat GPT doesn't quite do creativity is
2:29
not there yet but maybe Dennis will show it to us today after his PhD founded deepmind with two
2:38
colleagues deepmind which is uh you know the top AI company in the world
2:44
and it started very quickly making headlines in 2016 after alphago the
2:51
program they developed the Deep mines at Dennis was a Chief Architect beat a human professional goal player uh in a
2:58
five-game match Now goal was considered to be much harder than chess chess was done you know years ago as you probably
3:05
know and people didn't believe that actually AI based algorithms would be able to beat go and that means sure
3:13
enough proved the rest of the community wrong um then he went on
3:19
to several other developments of that sort I think the one that probably we
3:25
are most interested in as scientist is Alpha fold Alpha fold protein folding
3:30
prediction uh this is I quote Demis this is a lighthouse project our first major
3:37
investment in terms of people and resources into a fundamental very important real world scientific problem
3:45
and that's one of the reasons I'm so glad that epfl is giving uh doctoral
3:51
noise goes out to Dennis because he's true calling in life is to solve fundamental scientific problems so
3:58
mother of the other companies you can think of that are active in AI mostly
4:03
want to generate more clicks on ads or something else of that sort even though they pay your bills right uh but I think
4:12
if I may say but I think what I find extremely exciting at Deep Mind and also
4:18
the next company that he founded isomorphic Labs is that Dennis is really interested to
4:26
solve fundamental science problems and that's I think what we are all here to listen to
4:33
um he has so many prizes I tried to go through your Wikipedia page you know it took several of my screens so I decided
4:40
not to list all these prices but simply to say that um his work and the work of deepmind got
4:47
four times the Breakthrough of the year uh mentioned in Science magazine and
4:53
that's interesting because essentially it's computer science applied to science problems that essentially transform
5:00
science and I think that's also something very important I think computer science has a key role to play
5:06
in the 21st century to really attack fundamental science problems outside of
5:11
computer science okay those of you at epfl and who know me I have said this
5:17
many times computer science plays a central role it's potentially the physics of the 21st century and the
5:23
demonstration is done by Dennis hassabis and his team and other people working at
5:30
the Forefront of artificial intelligence now I'm going to finish by
5:35
something that is very unusual okay which is uh the British novelist Ian
5:41
mcaven in a book that you may have read which is called machines like me
5:46
which is an alternative history so it rewrites history from the 60s to now and
5:52
you have Alan Turing who is alive and works with his colleague Denis hasabis to really change the face of the World
5:59
by using Ai and computer science for the good of humanity I could make a court
6:05
here I I went up and looked a book but in the interest of time I suggest you read the book
6:11
so very good so this being said as I said there is a small formal part here
6:19
which is the delivery of the Dr Hal Roy scosa of epfl to Denisa sibis so I'll
6:27
read the lodesho I'll read it in English so
6:32
equal Polytechnic Federal confers the doctoral noise causal in to Dennis
6:38
hasebis in recognition of his Visionary leadership in artificial intelligence
6:43
and Neuroscience advancing the frontiers of science through his groundbreaking Innovations in AI driven scientific
6:51
research with this I would like to hand over and congratulate Dennis thank you
6:58
very much and we are going to thank you
7:13
thank you very much thank you very much thank you and with this I let you
7:20
take over using AI to accelerate scientific discovery I have to excuse myself unfortunately but I will watch
7:26
the video thank you all right enjoy the show Thanks Martin thanks says I'm fantastic
7:31
to be here and it's amazing honor to to receive the honorary doctorate and uh I've always um it's it's epfl I've
7:39
always admired epfl and we have many collaborations uh with the fusion lab here and also such an intellectual
7:45
environment here I've visited CERN nearby and it's an amazing place to do science so it's a real pleasure to be
7:52
here to to accept this award and give this talk so I'm going to talk today about how I
7:58
see using AI to accelerate scientific discovery itself and I'll also give just a quick preview of how we got to the
8:05
point we are now with working on things like Alpha fold and then I'm going to talk a little bit about how I see things
8:10
going into the future uh using AI to accelerate science
8:15
so we found it uh deepmind back in 2010 it's almost like another age now it
8:21
feels in terms of AI time uh but it was only you know of course 13 years ago and
8:26
back in 2010 nobody was using um uh no one was really thinking about working in AI certainly in in Industry
8:34
um and it's kind of amazing to see what's happened uh just in a few years uh going from 2010 where it was very
8:41
difficult to raise any money to work on AI uh in Industry to to now with billions of dollars going into AI
8:48
projects and it's been an incredible uh process to watch and be part of and we
8:54
found a deep mind at the end 2010 because we thought a lot of progress could be made if we brought together
8:59
Hardware advancements algorithm advancements and some knowledge about how the brain worked and get some
9:06
inspiration from from the brain for certain types of algorithms and systems and bring that all together with amazing
9:12
engineering and we felt back in 2010 that some very fast progress could be made the kind of progress that we've
9:18
seen although even that I think has been surprising to even those of us in the industry
9:24
so we tried to kind of form this Apollo program like effort a deepmind to make
9:29
bring together multi-disciplinary groups of amazing researchers and Engineers to make the most progress we could as fast
9:36
as possible our mission statement was to try and solve intelligence and then use it to
9:43
advance science and benefit Humanity by solving intelligence what we meant was
9:48
trying to understand the nature of intelligence and then recreate that uh in an artificial construct that I think
9:54
is the science of AI so we've started off our first big
10:01
result was with um classic Atari games from from the 1970s and uh our first
10:08
system called dqn Atari dqn was our first sort of successful big system
10:13
really back in around 2013 we got this working and what I was able to do is demonstrated I think the power of
10:20
learning systems it was the first uh really big system that was an end-to-end
10:25
learn system so um The Innovation here was that we didn't give the rules of the
10:31
game or the criteria of how to get points or anything to the system all we gave the system was the raw pixels on
10:36
the screen and it had to figure out everything else from first principles and being told the goal was to maximize
10:43
the score and that's it had to figure out the controls and the and how to get points and so on and so at the time uh
10:51
this was pretty astounding because no one had ever sort of done something at this kind of scale uh you know 100 by
10:56
200 pixels so the inputs was 20 000 pixel tools and that was pretty huge for any kind of neural net or or Learning
11:03
System this dqn system went on to kind of learn any to play any Atari game to better
11:10
than the best humans can play and get them to sort of maximize the score so for us this was a watershed moment I
11:16
think quite a watershed moment in the in in the field uh in terms of what what these Learning Systems might be able to
11:23
do if we train them in the right way so then as multi mentioned
11:30
um probably one of our biggest results starting the biggest one we had in gaming uh was alphago which was our
11:35
system in around 2015 2016 that we built to learn how to play go uh through a
11:42
self-learning process that I'll describe and kind of famously managed to beat uh the world champion at go the legendary
11:49
Lisa doll the South Korean uh Grand Master and why is go so much tougher
11:55
than chess and and other games to play well partly it's the complexity of go
12:00
um we've played humans have played go for thousands of years now has invented two three thousand years ago still as
12:07
popular as ever today over 40 million active players and one measure of the complexity of it is that there are
12:13
around 10 to the power 170 possible board positions uh in go Which is far
12:19
more than there are atoms in the observable universe so there's no way to kind of uh Brute Force
12:26
search through this incredibly complex uh combinatorial space in order to figure out uh what the Right Moves are
12:34
and the other extra thing that's hard about go is then you'll see a go board on the right there is that um it's quite
12:39
a esoteric aesthetic game it's one of the things that makes it beautiful and it's very difficult to write heuristics
12:46
or rules down about how to evaluate how a machine might evaluate a position and
12:51
and evaluate who's winning um so-called evaluation function which is critical to machines playing these
12:58
types of games and in chess it's a lot it's um it's because it's a material game it's a lot easier and a calculation
13:04
game it's a lot easier to actually specify what these heuristics are um but in go that's kind of impossible
13:10
so people have spent 20 years prior to alphago trying to hand craft these
13:16
heuristic systems to kind of describe um uh the aspects of a go position and
13:22
one of the issues is that because go is such an intuitive game even the top human players Grand Masters like Lisa
13:29
doll they don't really think about it in terms of calculations and rules it's much more about feeling uh and intuition
13:35
which are traditionally two things that you would say um are difficult for computers to do
13:42
so um alphago went on to win the match 4-1 in Seoul in 2016. um pretty famous
13:48
match it became over 200 million people watched the match around the world uh and there's a fantastic uh YouTube
13:54
documentary on it award-winning documentary on if you're interested to to see um how that played out
14:01
um but the interesting thing was not only the fact that it won the match of course but it was also how it won that
14:07
was pretty surprising and actually alphago created new strategies in go that had never been seen before even
14:14
though we've played this game for thousands of years and um and the most famous one of that was move 37 uh uh in
14:22
game two of the five game match which astounded the go world and still being sort of studied today and move 37 is
14:29
that um that Blackstone uh circled by the red there on the board and um and
14:35
this early in the game it's sort of Unthinkable to play uh that near to the center of the board it's sort of not
14:41
considered to be uh a a good strategy at all and in fact when the professional commentators were commentating live on
14:48
this game um they they thought there was an error in the computer system uh in order for it to play there so there was such a
14:55
surprising move um and it's interesting actually just to touch on and maybe we can touch on this in the Q a is what does um this mean
15:02
about creativity uh and intuition these sorts of um aspects that we think are very cognitive
15:08
um and I think when I reflect back on this I I would say that there are at least three levels of creativity and
15:14
perhaps alphago and systems like that the current systems we have exhibit the first two so if we think about
15:20
interpolation um that's you know if you imagine you ask us one of these genitive systems to
15:26
imagine you know show a picture of a cat um maybe uh it will have seen millions
15:32
of pictures of cats before and then it does some kind of interpolation or averaging of all the cats that it's seen
15:38
and then it produces a sort of prototypical cat and outputs that as an image
15:43
um so you know that's an original cat it doesn't exist in the training set but it's a simple sort of matter relatively
15:50
simple matter of kind of averaging across the exemplars that it's seen the second type of creatives and the
15:56
higher level is extrapolation where you you sort of sample the distribution uh
16:02
and so in alphago's case you know maybe you look at all the human games that have been played online and you start
16:07
building up patterns of what are reasonable things to do and go reasonable positions but actually you
16:14
then not just simply average uh what you've seen but you actually extrapolate these motifs into new parts of the
16:20
distribution that perhaps um uh that are not in the training set beyond the training set and I think this
16:27
is what move 37 is an alphago has clearly and systems like this have
16:32
clearly demonstrated and I think that's very exciting if you think about the potential for that in science uh to
16:38
extrapolate Beyond uh make you know models of the current distribution we can see and then extrapolate to come to
16:44
New conclusions and new ideas that are beyond the boundaries of what we have data for and then finally and I think
16:51
today systems don't do this you know maybe we can call it invention or out of the box thinking which I think is an
16:57
even higher level of maybe abstract creativity that of course we as humans do effortlessly
17:03
um but so far I would say machines don't do and I think the easiest way I can give you an example of that is of course
17:09
alphago was able to make the these amazing creative strategies in go but it
17:15
couldn't invent go right or invent chess that's that to me would be a new level
17:20
of uh invention and I don't think that's impossible I think that's just partly actually the maybe the limitations of
17:27
the current systems but also the limitations of the way we're able to describe the goals to these systems
17:33
um so you know I think if you were to get a human game designer like the sorts of things I used to do to try and come
17:40
up with go from scratch you know you might say something like come up with a board game that is beautiful
17:47
aesthetically that takes five minutes to learn the rules there's only a couple of rules for Go but takes you know maybe
17:53
multiple lifetimes to master and you complete a game in you know maybe six
17:58
hours so within a human uh life afternoon so to be convenient so maybe
18:03
you would specify these kinds of goals and then go would be you know an answer
18:09
to to satisfy those goals but you you can see that would be very high level specification if one was to do that
18:15
which so far our systems wouldn't I don't think be able to cope with that
18:21
so just to explain a little bit about how alphago works and I'm actually combining several pieces of work here
18:27
together when I describe this this is sort of simplified description of how all of these types of systems work this
18:32
includes alphago and its successor programs alphago zero and Alpha zero and Alpha zero actually uh is a kind of
18:40
General games playing system that can play any two-player board game uh a perfect information game uh better than
18:47
uh world champion level and so the process is actually quite simple to describe so you start off with a neural
18:53
network initialize neural network that basically plays randomly and that's you can think of that as version one of the
19:00
system and it plays around a hundred thousand games of whatever board game is playing that creates a data set of these
19:07
hundred thousand games and all the positions in those games and then you train a second uh uh version of the
19:13
neural network on that data set and what you're trying to do here in the neural Network's got two jobs it's got to
19:19
predict the probability of who will win from that particular position and How likely they are to win which whether
19:25
it's the which of the two sides will win uh and also what are the what are the more probable moves that um might be
19:32
tried in a certain position so that's the the sort of two prediction jobs of the of the neural network
19:37
um then when you've trained version two on this version one data you have a little hundred game tournament uh and
19:44
you match off version two against his predecessor uh and um and you have this hundred Match Game and then if it wins a
19:51
significant amount of time uh we set the threshold to be 55 win rate then you replace the um the current uh system
19:59
with with the new one so you replace version one with version two and then
20:04
you you do this whole cycle again you play another hundred thousand games but this time version two playing against
20:09
itself you generate a new data set slightly higher quality because version
20:14
two is slightly better than version one and then you train a version three and and that that matches off against version two now if version 3 turns out
20:23
not to be better than version two statistically better then you continue to generate another hundred thousand
20:29
samples with the current version the current version two so you end up creating 200 000 games then for the new
20:35
version three to be trained and eventually uh the new version will be the old version and if you do this um
20:42
system in in in terms of go uh 17 times uh different games require different
20:47
amounts of Cycles you go from playing randomly to uh uh better than any entity
20:53
on the planet has ever played go and it's quite a thing to watch live especially in something like chess which
20:58
I I I know well you know you start the process off in the morning at breakfast
21:04
um you know around uh coffee time at 11AM you can still beat the system or you know and then by lunchtime it's
21:10
better than world champion it's actually quite amazing to actually watch that live uh as as you're sort of you know uh
21:16
going through your morning so it's quite a thing and it's it's very visceral if you play chess or play one of these
21:21
games games to see that live in front of you that whole process so um what what's going on here then
21:28
well effectively if one thinks of um a go tree as the tree of all possibilities
21:33
and you imagine each node in this tree is a go position so you're currently in this you know the current position is
21:39
the top of the tree and um you've got this enormous you know uh set of
21:44
possibilities from each position you know uh the 10 to the 170 possible positions and you've got to find this
21:50
sort of classic needle or Haystack how do we decide what the optimal strategy is the optimal move to play from this
21:55
kind of position in a very finite amount of time you know maybe one minute of thinking time so Canadian is not tractable to do this
22:02
in any kind of vaguely you know any kind of Brute Force way or exhaustive way so what we're basically doing is guiding
22:09
the search with the model so the model is coming up with uh uh most probable
22:14
moves uh the and the kind of most interesting moves to look at and therefore guiding the tree search to be
22:20
very efficient in the in the in the budget that it uses the the sort of Monte Carlo tree search maybe it can
22:25
only search around 10 000 moves per per decision and it's got to apply that very
22:30
limited budget of search budget to most appropriately to the entire uh to the
22:36
entire search tree and then when it runs out of time of course then it outputs
22:42
um the best uh uh plan the best tree that it's uh uh at the best sort of path that it's found up to that point
22:50
so we've been pretty lucky and using games and and we started with games I mean partly you've seen my background in
22:56
games and I try to utilize every single strand of the things I've experienced in my career to bring them together to
23:03
always make use of them uh and I always had in mind even though as Martin was describing all these different things I
23:08
I did earlier in my career um from probably around 14 15 years old I I had already decided that AI was
23:16
going to be my career and this is what I wanted to do with my life and then all the other things I picked to do from the
23:21
phds to writing AI for computer games was um was was sort of in preparation if
23:27
you like for doing something like deepmind and then we made use of this all this games knowledge and we have quite a lot of amazing games Engineers X
23:34
Games engineers at deepmind who who work on these simulations and work on these programs we worked on games because we
23:41
thought it would be the fastest way to make efficient progress with testing out algorithmic ideas
23:47
um and uh and that turned out to be a case I'm really fortunate to make a whole bunch of big breakthroughs I've
23:52
just talked about the eqn and alphago and Alpha zero and then we culminated in this program called Alpha star which um
23:59
uh beat a gram the grand Masters in the most complex computer game strategy game called Starcraft 2 which has all sorts
24:06
of other challenges from board games like partially observable um uh environment and it needs long-term
24:12
planning and other other big challenges so with that that you know games has
24:17
been phenomenal for uh for getting uh making progress over uh almost a decade
24:23
worth of work to get the algorithms to a point where they were sophisticated enough to be applied to challenging real
24:29
world problems and of course that's problems commercial problems and Industrial problems and pretty much
24:35
every uh system that you use now at Google has a piece of deepmind technology in it
24:41
from the the way the massive data centers are called to the voice on any
24:47
of the devices that you speak to uh the Google Device you speak to are use wavenet which is the world's best
24:52
text-to-speech most realistic test to speech system a piece of deepmind technology is is sort of in almost every
24:59
service but for me in my passion my personal passion as Martin was saying is to eventually was always the plan was to
25:05
use AI as this incredible tool almost like the ultimate tool for helping accelerate scientific discovery and and
25:12
I think in the last few years maybe two three four years I think that's because come possible and I think it's a really
25:18
exciting time now in AI uh to do this to bring over all of these Amazing Ideas that were developed in areas like games
25:25
and other theoretical domains and bring that to the to real world important problems
25:31
so for me I always had my eye on and I learned about the protein folding problem and I'll describe that very
25:37
briefly for those of you don't know what it is uh in my undergraduate in the 90s at Cambridge I had a I had quite a lot
25:44
of biologist friends there and one of them was particularly obsessed with this protein voting problem and
25:49
um and still works on protein structure today in Cambridge as a as a as an academic and um and always sort of
25:56
thought first of all that it would be tractable one day but also that it would be enormously important if one could
26:01
solve this problem and I and I I really I've always loved this problem I've always thought it would have sort of
26:06
filed it away in the back recesses of my mind as one day to come back to as we progress with AI because I thought it'd
26:13
be very suitable for AI for a number of reasons so the protein folding problem is quite simple to explain proteins for those who
26:19
don't know obviously the workhorses of biology they're essential to all life everything in your body is is pretty
26:25
much supported by proteins and of course we'd like to know their function uh and
26:30
their function uh is partially specified by their 3D structure so if you imagine the protein is
26:36
um is is is specified by its amino acid sequence which you can Loosely think of as this genetic sequence and then
26:43
um in the in the in nature it folds up into this 3D structure and that's what kind of governs its function
26:50
now determining the structure of of these of these proteins often takes many many years if you're going to do this
26:56
experimentally with a lot of painstaking work perhaps many of you in the in the in the audience work on these things and
27:03
um you know the rule of thumb that again biologist friend have always told me is it can take a whole PhD uh uh you know
27:09
four or five years to maybe even crystallize and figure out one protein structure so it's it's really a lot of
27:15
work and um and Christian and finson very famously in his 1972 uh uh lecture
27:22
for his Nobel lecture uh speculated that the 3D structure of protein should be
27:27
formally determinable uh by the amino acid sequence in other words we should be able to predict this 3D structure uh
27:34
immediately uh based just on solely on its sequence now of course that then triggered
27:40
literally a 50-year kind of Grand Challenge in biology um and um and people have been trying to
27:47
make progress on this uh ever since and it's obviously a whole field in itself
27:53
so why is this such a hard problem to solve uh this structure prediction problem the structure prediction problem
27:59
of the protein folding problem can it be solved computationally and why is this such a hard problem well again uh
28:05
according to a contemporary of events and uh Leventhal uh leventh house Paradox you know he sort of back of an
28:10
envelope calculated then maybe there's roughly 10 to the 300 possible uh confirmations that an average protein
28:17
can take and yet obviously the Paradox is that in nature uh obviously
28:22
spontaneously you know within milliseconds uh in many cases so how is this possible how does physics solve
28:29
this then um you know is the big question and the other reason we picked this problem is
28:34
that there's a fantastic uh really well run competition called Casp that runs
28:39
every two years and has been running for nearly 30 years now and it's considered to be the gold standard Benchmark in in
28:46
protein folding to test the best computational systems and it's a blind test so
28:51
um experimentalists submit their their structures just prior to publishing uh
28:57
for the competition and computationally after you have to submit your prediction and then later on they reveal the um the
29:04
ground truth structure experimental structure and then you compare the ground truth against your prediction and
29:09
uh usually uh for every cycle of the competition they have around 100 proteins that they've collected uh like
29:15
that that they sort of withhold publication of
29:21
as many of you know now or did achieve Atomic accuracy so this is accuracy of
29:27
the computational prediction uh to within uh the width of an atom which is
29:33
um what we were told was that the tolerance for it to be useful for uh real world biology and chemistry and uh
29:39
and we we achieve this accuracy at cast 14 the 14th Edition of Casp in in November 2020. and if you look at um the
29:47
the progress of um Casp and the winning team this is the score of the winning team uh in in each
29:54
of the additions back the prior 10 years to we entered so from 2006 to 2016
30:00
there'd been almost no progress on the hardest category so-called free modeling category where there are no prior
30:06
templates for these proteins and um and and you know this score on the on the
30:11
y-axis is a you can think of it as roughly it's called gdt where you can think of it as roughly as the percentage of residues you've got accurately
30:19
positioned uh to within a our tolerance a very tight tolerance and um and so
30:25
they were stuck around 40 uh pretty much which is not useful uh in any way for
30:31
experimentalists it's it's far too large in errors and um and in 2018 we we
30:36
entered for the first time we started this work in 2016. the whole project is probably the most complex
30:42
project we've ever worked on and we started it literally pretty much the day after we came back from from Seoul from
30:48
Korea uh from the alphago match this was the next big project we took on and
30:54
Alpha fold one we entered into cast 13 and for the first time ever we sort of entered a A system that had cutting-edge
31:01
machine learning at the core of the system for the first time um and it improved accuracy immediately
31:07
from the previous sort of winning scores by around 50 as you can see here and then we totally re-architected Alpha
31:14
Fall 2 um with a whole bunch of new Innovations and taking the learnings from alpha fold one and then that finally reached Atomic
31:21
accuracy which had led the organizers of Casp um to declare that the problem had been
31:27
in inverted Commerce solved so how does this look well Alpha fold
31:33
um takes many iterative steps towards solving a protein structure and you can see this enormously complex protein on
31:40
the left here is just one example of one of the the structures that Alpha fold uh predicted
31:46
um and you can see the ground truth in in in in uh in green and and in blue is the is the prediction and you can see on
31:53
the right hand side how the different iterative steps are alpha fold sort of settles on a final prediction of the of
32:01
the structure and it's still amazing to me when I watch these things and and see the complexity of then the beautifulness
32:08
actually of of proteins uh how how this can you know be computationally predicted is still pretty astounding to
32:14
me so then we went on to um obviously publish all the methods we
32:20
open source the code and um and then we decided like how are we going to uh
32:26
share this with the world so that the biology Community could make best use of it and we actually decided that the best
32:31
way to do this was to create a database freely available database with free and unrestricted access to all the
32:37
structures that Alpha 4 predicted and we did this in a great collaboration with emble ebi European bioinformatics
32:43
Institute uh just up the road from us in Cambridge uh in the UK and normally when
32:49
you do these types of systems you set up a server and then people submit uh
32:56
experimentalists submit their structure they're interested in uh their sequence they're interested in and then you predict a structure and you send it back
33:02
maybe a few days later that's the normal way people used to do uh uh uh was to provide access to these systems but
33:09
because Alpha fold 2 was so fast as well as so accurate we realized that actually over the course of a year we could
33:15
actually just fold every protein known to science so that's around 200 million
33:20
depending how you count it obviously growing all the time and uh so we ended up over the course of a year folding
33:26
every protein um there was and uh that we could get our hands on in the uniprot data set uh
33:32
database and then we uh we put we made that available of course before we did that just as a as a as a side note and
33:38
I'll come back to this at the end um we always have safety and ethics at the Forefront of our mind of every work
33:43
that we do so before we release such a massive database we consulted actually with over 30 experts in many uh relevant
33:50
fields of course biology but also biosecurity bioethics Pharma and and uh
33:56
and also our human rights too and from that we actually made some slight modifications to what we were going to
34:01
to put out there but the overwhelming feedback from from all of them was that the the benefits far outweighed any any
34:09
perceived risk so since then so it's been out for you
34:14
know Alpha folds been sort of available for a couple of years now or maybe getting on to three years and um already
34:20
uh it's been incredibly uh uh um sort of gratifying to see how many uh things
34:27
that uh Alpha fold has been applied to and the wide range of important problems it's being used for and here's just a
34:33
small sample of those uh of those uh uh problems that have been tackled using Alpha full predictions and there are
34:40
many more on our website unfolded.deepmind.com uh where you can see many more sort of testimonies and
34:46
and examples case studies of of how alpha Falls being used and I'll just highlight a few here
34:52
um it's been used by the University of Portsmouth to do design sort of plastic eating enzymes to tackle plastic
34:58
pollution it's been used all over the place in big Pharma for drug Discovery from and also in Academia antibiotic
35:05
resistance and malaria vaccines and also neglected diseases which is very important part of our mission uh neglect
35:11
a tropical diseases is like leishmaniasis and Dengue that we think I
35:16
often don't have a lot of investment in from Pharma that the ngos that work on these types of diseases uh it was great
35:24
for them to get an immediate leg up by seeing the structures of the proteins that they were trying to Target and
35:29
obviously do get straight into drug Discovery and then it's also being used in fundamental research too for for
35:36
example helping with finding the structure of the nuclear poor complex and also designing things like molecular
35:42
protein syringes for delivering payloads uh into the body so incredible diversity
35:48
of of different things and this is always what we hope for for working on this problem of of protein structure
35:55
prediction was that if it could be done it would unlock uh if we were in this new world of sort of protein structure
36:01
abundance it could unlock that all these Downstream amazing pieces of research
36:07
we've been very lucky as well in the terms of it's being recognized after fold by very nice uh accolades like
36:13
Breakthrough of the Year from science method of the Year from nature but also the amount that is being used has been incredible so over a million researchers
36:20
and biologists have used Alpha fold in the databases from all around the world pretty much every country in the world
36:26
and the methods papers had over 10 000 citations already
36:31
so just in terms of the higher bigger picture then if I step out of bed now and start looking at where is all this
36:37
going um I like to use this phrase of science at digital speed and I think we're going
36:44
to start seeing this more and more now and what do I mean by that well I mean science at digital speed in two
36:49
different ways um first of all if you take Alpha fold um it's extremely fast solution of
36:55
course so you can fold uh get the structure of a protein in a matter of seconds instead of potentially you know
37:02
months or years if one will have to do that experimentally so the solution itself is very fast and that allows us
37:09
to scale up to you know 200 million proteins but also the dissemination of that information is also at digital
37:15
speed because it's a it's a it's a it's a technical solution so you know the
37:21
moment you've you've kind of built the algorithm and you folded all the proteins we can then put it on the database and everyone in the world can
37:26
then access it uh just with a simple keyword search so if you compare that to an experimental breakthrough you know
37:33
amazing ones and they go they still made me take a decade it can take or more to
37:39
propagate through training phds on those systems building the right Hardware uh
37:44
equipment in order for those to work and training people to use those new techniques
37:50
um and instead of you know something a science of digital speed is able to propagate almost immediately
37:55
um just like any other piece of software or technology so I think this is maybe the first example of that but I think
38:02
it's an interesting phenomenon that I think we'll start seeing a lot more of
38:07
and just following up on that theme then if I I I like to think of that maybe we're entering a new era of what we like
38:14
to call digital biology and um I think if you think about biology at its most fundamental level I think we
38:20
can think of it as an information processing system so um I'll be at a very complex emergent
38:27
one and um if we think of it in that way then in the same way that maths was the perfect
38:33
description language for physics and physics phenomena perhaps um I think you know AI could end up
38:39
being perfect for this type of complex emergent regime to describe and model uh
38:46
what's going on in biology I think it may turn out to be the perfect fit for AI
38:52
so I'm hoping that Alpha fold is a sort of proof of concept if you like and when we look back on it maybe 10 years from
38:59
now uh it won't just be this isolated uh success story but actually we'll see
39:04
that it heralded this new era uh of uh digital biology and we've actually followed up on this
39:11
ourselves by starting a new spin out company called isomorphic labs to try and reimagine the whole drug Discovery
39:18
process from first principles with AI um of course the pro to you know Alpha
39:23
fold and the protein structure is just one very small aspect of doing drug
39:29
Discovery right where one small piece of the whole puzzle an important piece but um nonetheless just one piece so we need
39:36
to fill in all of these other modules that that are required actually to do drug Discovery from Target Discovery to
39:43
uh designing chemical compounds and designing drugs
39:48
so ifosomorphics approaches to sort of try and Tackle these most fundamental problems in drug design with this AI
39:54
first or computational first approach and then we combine several advantages from different areas we have the new
40:00
company has close collaborations with uh with deepmind and they are Ai and science teams there it also has huge
40:07
resources and funding from alphabet the parent company of all of these companies uh to allow us to kind of think long
40:13
term and ambitiously which um and so we can really try and go after the fundamental research to begin with to
40:20
build this platform uh this general purpose platform a bit like we did I showed you with games uh at the early
40:26
part of the talk and we also get to utilize of course all of Google's uh enormous sort of infrastructure which of
40:32
course is incredibly important for computational and AI approaches and we get to do all of that so sort of take
40:38
advantage of a big company backing but within the context of a fast-paced and
40:43
Nimble startup environment we pulled together this world-class multidisciplinary team I'm a real
40:49
believer in multi-disciplinary research work we've always had that a deep mind and we have that also isomorphic
40:55
incredible team across AI chemistry bio physics and and engineering and we were
41:01
lucky enough to have this amazing scientific Advisory Board that's been set up with um several Nobel laureates
41:07
and uh excisely you know we have offices in London but we've also opened uh an
41:12
office here in lausanne actually in the Innovation Park uh just locally and I
41:17
have some of my colleagues here actually here today from from the lausanne office which is amazing so another great reason for me to be visiting
41:25
so that's where we're going now and I swear I see uh these types of techniques and I think we can you know isomorphic
41:31
in a deep mind we're trying to create maybe half a dozen more Alpha fold-like systems but in different parts of the of
41:39
of the chain that's required to do drug discovery so maybe if I finish Now by just taking
41:45
a further State back and looking at the holistically about all the work that we've done over the last decade plus and
41:53
I think it goes back to that search tree Irish I was showing you um I think a lot of AI can be kind of thought of in the
42:01
most General way in this way that you have these enormous combinatorial spaces
42:06
um you know whatever the problem is that you're trying to solve and there's huge numbers of combinations that can be uh
42:12
that need to be searched and what you do to make that tractable is you learn a model of that environment either
42:18
directly from data or from simulations uh in in some cases or ideally you have
42:24
both and then you use that model to guide the search in a tractable way according to some objective function
42:31
and I think it's pretty simple to describe but actually if you think about AI in this way
42:36
um I think there's and actually start looking for problems you can apply it to it turns out this is a very general solution and actually many problems can
42:44
be uh modified to fit this pattern so here's the go tree again
42:51
um with all the the search tree and and how it finds this optimal plan and the
42:56
optimal moves um and now if we replace um this is obviously a cartoon but it just gives you the idea if we replace go
43:03
positions now with chemical compounds you know one could imagine uh building
43:09
up uh new drugs or or new chemical compounds that are useful for things using a some kind of search uh I like
43:16
this but in this case the model will be modeling uh chemistry space and chemical
43:21
properties we've actually had a pretty amazing couple of years now in Sciences
43:28
um applying these types of systems and other systems to all sorts of scientific domains not just biology
43:33
we've done some great work in quantum chemistry in pure mathematics solving some important conjectures in
43:39
collaboration with some amazing uh field prize mathematicians Fusion here
43:45
collaborating with the Fantastic Team here epfl to control Plasma in a fusion
43:52
reactor and um and then work on genomics weather prediction all sorts of uh
43:57
domains and I think it's just the beginning of what we're gonna see this sort of real flourishing of applying AI
44:04
this kind of general purpose AI general purpose Learning Systems to pretty much every branch of science
44:13
so just then a word of it's on on pining responsibly and and how is one uh
44:19
undertake this work carefully and uh and ethically it's very very exciting time I
44:25
think AI has the incredible potential to to help with almost all of Humanity's greatest challenges from
44:31
um curing diseases to uh energy and sustainability in the environment
44:37
um I think AI has the potential to help with all of these problems but um of course it's an incredibly powerful
44:43
technology and um and it can be used uh it's a dual purpose technology depends
44:48
on what we as society decide we're going to deploy and use it for and and how we
44:54
build it and it needs to be built responsibly and safely and to be used for the benefit of everyone and as I mentioned from the beginning
45:00
even back in 2010 when we were little tiny little office space in an attic in in London
45:06
um we were planning for Success when we when we started in 2010 we imagined a world like we have we're in today and
45:14
actually even Beyond where we're going to be in the next 10 years and uh we imagined that and we so therefore if one
45:19
were to imagine this kind of world you would be thinking about ethics and safety from the beginning and that's what we were doing and it's been Central
45:26
to our mission from the start we've always had an Ethics Charter um and uh an Ethics Committee and that's
45:33
actually evolved now into the whole of Google having their published AI principles so now we're part of Google
45:39
uh we we help across the board now uh in across the whole company uh with
45:44
applying these principles uh correctly um everywhere where we deploy AI
45:50
and we continue to try and provide this thought leadership on AI strategy globally risks and ethics and safety for
45:56
the whole research community and Beyond so how should we Pioneer responsibly
46:03
this is what obviously I'm sure you all agree this is what we should do with this type of Technology um and my my view is that we actually
46:09
have a a way to approach this um and we call this artificial general intelligence you know when we get to
46:16
human level uh uh cognitive capabilities across the board with these systems and
46:21
I think we're approaching that pivotal moment in human history quite rapidly maybe it's a few years away
46:27
um and my view is that we should not move fast and break things which is the
46:32
kind of Silicon Valley Mantra that of course is very successful in building social media and huge companies and
46:38
getting uh very uh uh great growth for applications and Technologies and it
46:45
served us very well but I think when it comes to something as consequential as
46:51
AGI I think instead we should be sort of looking towards the scientific method
46:56
which of course you'll all be familiar with here and I think that's the approach that we should be taking talking with these kinds of systems so
47:02
thoughtful deliberation hypothesis generation and rigorous testing of those hypotheses then carefully controlled
47:08
environments and conditions detailed analysis updating rapidly on empirical data
47:15
perhaps with external review and all with the aim to get a better understanding of these systems before we
47:22
deploy them in the wild and I think the key thing here is sort of not so much
47:28
not to move fast because um you know I think we need to move at PACE with these systems because of the
47:34
enormous potential they have but ideally not to break things right or as far as possible not to do that with uh and and
47:42
use as much foresight as possible so I think a transformative technology like AGI requires exceptional care and
47:49
and our view at a deepminder Google is that we need to be bold and responsible
47:54
with this technology and it really is an ad and I think I think although those I think those two words
48:00
um there's some tension there I think it's a good tension to have so I'll just finish them by saying if we
48:07
realize the full potential of AGI and and build these types of systems I think there'll be the ultimate general purpose
48:13
tool to help us as scientists understand the universe and perhaps our place in it thank you very much
48:20
[Applause]
48:28
foreign [Applause]
48:34
for this impressive demonstration of the power of the tools you've uh you've built we have sometimes for a few
48:40
questions for the audience so the house rule is you need to come to the standing microphones that are situated here and
48:46
there make a line if you have uh if many of you wish to to ask a question and we'll take them one after the other in
48:53
the in the time that we have at our disposal I have maybe one first question yes white people can come into into the
48:59
line you've shown how it worked your your system on go on on video games and
49:05
then how what kind of mental shift did it take to someday say hey it would probably work on proteins as well
49:12
well um for me it's you know maybe it looks like that if you um
49:18
you know I think the missing piece of information if you if you look at my career is that I had already decided uh
49:24
and actually through chess originally it was games that got me to AI because um most of you too young in the audience
49:30
remember this but when I was playing chess in the 80s uh sort of semi-professionally when I was a kid I
49:35
was using chess computers to train on and they were the originally they were these physical boards that you would
49:41
actually press the squares on and they had little LED lights and uh and I was
49:47
fascinated I must have been about eight nine years old when I got my first one that that uh how were they programmed
49:52
you know this this machine this this bit of plastic in front of me you know how was it playing chess and helping me
49:59
train and I think that that was I kind of determined at that point that I wanted to learn actually how this how to
50:05
program machines to do that and in some ways that was more fascinating even than than the game itself was actually how
50:11
these systems were were programmed and so then I went into professional computer games development but if you
50:17
look at all the games that I made Park all of these things actually the Common Core theme was it had AI as the core
50:23
part of the gameplay and again that just reinforced I saw something my probably most famous camera was theme park when I
50:29
was around 17 years old and it was designing your own Disney World and then little people came into your Disney
50:35
World theme park and played on your rides and designed the park and they all had AI controlling them and when I saw
50:41
people enjoy that so much to how the game reacted to the player I sort of realized how much AI could bring to the
50:48
world so then everything else I've done and sort of collected was with this in mind where where what we see today in
50:54
mind thank you very much so we'll start on that side please make short questions hello uh thanks for an excellent talk uh
51:01
your body of work and the journey has been very inspiration to me so the my question is the following when you are
51:08
building for the first time these complex systems like Alpha zero I'm pretty sure many people have tried
51:14
before and fed so for what for you what was like the conviction or the inspiration that somehow will build
51:19
these systems that will turn out to be like a amazing breakthrough so can you give us a sneak peek into sure so so
51:26
back in um perhaps when I was when when I was doing my undergrad um one of my really good friends at
51:32
Cambridge was this guy called David Silva who ended up being he's one of the best reinforcement learning people in
51:38
the world but also he um ended up being the lead Project Lead on alphago and we
51:43
used to talk about and um he was also part of my first games company he was the CTO and um we always used to think
51:49
about go actually which I learned at Cambridge there was a lot of um there's a really good go Club there and we both
51:55
learned go there and we were always fascinated by how would we program that and we tried actually in in the early
52:02
2000s to do it in the way that the classical chess programs are being written with these heuristics and search
52:07
and it kind of gets you nowhere you can't even you know get to strong amateur like that so we sort of shelved
52:14
it for uh 10 years really and we decided then that actually you needed a learning approach that just confirmed our
52:20
intuition that there's no way that you can we can enumerate out all the heuristics for something complex like
52:26
that um even something like go let alone uh more General things than that
52:32
um I think that reinforced our opinion that you needed learning systems and that were General
52:38
thank you thanks thank you very much let's take a question from the other side of the room hello hello thanks for the great
52:45
presentation um fascinating to see what's going on in this in this domain especially uh I'm
52:52
glad to see that there's a progress in terms of drug Discovery and I can
52:57
imagine that investors are queuing up and so um we also know that in this particular
53:03
domain of Industry not all the well let's say some of the larger investors have proven that
53:11
um sometimes colossal profits are more important than any ethical consideration
53:16
so my question is how do you it is isomorphic Labs think about the monetization aspects and do you make any
53:24
promises in terms of um um enlarging access to medication for
53:30
the entire human population including the large part in the majority Who currently don't have it yeah well look I
53:38
I I I can't make any promises but I can definitely tell you the the intention is and the idea is that if this all works
53:46
out you know with this computational approaches which should be maybe even an order of magnitude faster to develop new
53:54
drugs you know maybe instead of 10 years one year you could imagine and therefore maybe an auto magnitude cheaper to
54:00
develop those things you know perhaps more perhaps even too old of magnitude as possible and then I think
54:06
um if you have both those two things it's far easier to distribute that and work on many many diseases not just
54:13
first world diseases in wealthy countries you know where I think farmer
54:18
traditionally has to make its sort of calculations and actually you can do a a
54:24
lot more and I think we've seen the beginnings of that with Alpha hold as I mentioned one of the places we collaborated with I think they're
54:30
actually based in Switzerland was the dndi drugs for neglected diseases Institute it's part of I think who and
54:38
um and uh we folded you know all of the proteins and all the the diseases that affect mostly the developing world and
54:44
the poorer parts of the world but affect millions of people there hundreds of millions actually but are generally
54:49
underserved by the current Pharma industry so I really hope that the work we're going to do is going to allow us
54:55
to uh uh uh um broaden that access and then maybe also make uh you know act as
55:02
a role model to Pharma to to do more of that too like open sourcing medication
55:07
yes for sure exactly for these for these um uh for these you know these uh these
55:12
these sort of diseases that affect the developing World more yeah that would be wonderful people are also queuing up to
55:18
ask questions so thank you very much uh so quick question so uh what happened what turned
55:25
out to be harder than your thoughts and would turn out to be easier than you thought over the last uh well 13 years
55:32
yeah so um you know in in a way there were so many
55:38
it's kind of hard to remember because there's so many different projects we've done and at all times there were difficult moments I think one of the
55:44
hardest moments was after Alpha fold one um trying to push Alpha fold one to
55:51
reach the atomic accuracy so that's the first thing we tried to do in roughly 2018 was push that first system and
55:58
after around six months we realized it couldn't go any further and we had to go back to the drawing board and use what
56:05
we learned but actually re-architect everything and for a long time probably another six months maybe even a year it
56:12
would the new system Alpha Fall 2 was worse than Alpha fold one and you have to you have to be very confident and
56:18
brave and persistent when you go through that those periods to you know just trust that it's going to come back and
56:25
then it has more potential to go further because of the way you've re-architected it so that was um that was with Alpha
56:31
Fall 2 and then maybe uh on what when what's gone easier I guess you could imagine language modeling has perhaps
56:37
surprised everyone I think on the whole research Community including us of how
56:43
um that may be relatively easy that was uh once Transformers and rlhf had been
56:48
invented you know five six years ago thank you thank you we have five more minutes to go so I'm afraid we won't be
56:55
able to take all questions time moves very fast but please next one okay so first off thank you very much for your
57:00
work amazing and I want to ask if there are any plans to address any quality in regards with the uh alums or students
57:08
from non-elite universities which usually have less funding less collaboration opportunities less visibility on their work so do you plan
57:15
to address that because it usually is also an indicator of socio-economic uh circumstances and usually most of the
57:22
inclusiveness work is regarding the individual circumstances and not so much the context of the person yes we we care
57:30
about that very much and actually we have very big uh uh diversity and inclusion efforts at deepmind and
57:37
um we we sponsor it's mostly in the UK currently but we're going to try and make it more International hundreds of
57:43
Masters students scholarships from underrepresented backgrounds both socioeconomic and other types of
57:49
underrepresented backgrounds and and um so and we've encouraged the UK government to do that so actually now
57:54
they provide thousands of scholarships to the Masters level for machine learning so the idea I think we picked
58:00
Masters level because that's a it's almost like a conversion course from stem undergrad you know science undergrad or math undergrad and then
58:07
getting them into machine learning and then either phds or into industry so that's worked really well we've also
58:12
sponsored um uh funded several chairs in machine learning at many of the universities uh
58:18
in different parts of the regions of the UK and also internationally and then recently we did a five million dollar
58:24
sponsorship to the African Institute mathematical site uh Sciences to kind of
58:30
train the best students in Africa who are already in the mathematical Society uh in machine learning uh with uh you
58:38
know and actually one of we've seconded one of our senior research scientists to be the director of that in in South
58:43
Africa of the whole Institute uh for the next I think five years so we're trying to do a lot of things around that but
58:51
all needs to be done thank you very much great thank you very much next question please yes thank you
58:56
so much and um more than 10 years ago you bet on something that few people believed in
59:02
and now ai is something that everybody is jumping in so um what do you imagine AI can do not
59:11
for science but also for Humanity in general in the future how far it can go
59:16
yeah I I think I've always imagined um there's almost no limits in some way
59:22
to AI because if you look around us in modern civilization how did we create
59:27
modern civilizers what we see all the amazing things we see around us um it was with intelligence right so
59:35
um and I think if you think back I do you know if you do thought experiments like you imagine going back to uh uh
59:41
pre-agricultural era and you you talk to a tribes person then about you know one
59:47
day we'll build Manhattan in New York and fly over in a 747 uh in 10 hours you
59:53
know it's it's would be Unthinkable and I think about intelligence human intelligence has done that and I think
59:59
that there'll be almost as big another Revolution with these tools and and helping us solve all incredible problems
1:00:06
uh that we think are quite intractable today maybe like energy sources material
1:00:11
design I'm thinking as well as biology and Drug design curing hundreds of diseases
1:00:17
um I think that's all within reach uh and then I hope we would have a much more
1:00:22
um you know obviously you can call it radical abundance much more uh equality in the world and lots of these huge
1:00:29
problems some of which we've created for ourselves as a society like climate uh we have we'll have really great
1:00:34
solutions to um with AI helping the best experts in the world to solve these problems thank
1:00:40
you thank you very much one here hello I'm Leon from open knowledge
1:00:46
Association and I have a question linked to the use case of infrastructure do you
1:00:52
intend to to use infrastructure AI in the infrastructure field for example for
1:00:58
Waste Management or like can be simulation for the buildings or stuff like this yeah great
1:01:05
question I'd love to do that I think there's huge potential in using AI to optimize existing infrastructure
1:01:11
transport and power grids and so on I think to get maybe even like 30 40 more
1:01:16
out of them that's what we found with the data centers we optimize these massive data centers that Google uses and Powers all search YouTube and so on
1:01:23
we save 30 of the energy uh from the cooling systems by using AI to control them and they already were quite
1:01:30
optimized systems but you can even imagine things like shipping shipping lanes I mean there's a huge amount of
1:01:35
pollution is caused by that and just being more optimal on Logistics as well as inventing new Solutions like the
1:01:41
plastic heating enzymes I mentioned or designing ways to deal with waste uh
1:01:47
recycling I think all of that AI could help that you know that entire uh industry actually if we if we embed it
1:01:54
in that thank you very inspiring thank you sorry to be the nasty timekeeper but this would be the last question
1:02:01
first thank you for the very nice presentation really looking forward to the progress of Science of our domestic
1:02:06
next decades my question is how do you see the role of Open Source in AI over the next decades and what do you see to
1:02:13
be the most the best approach to AI in terms of balancing the the risks of of
1:02:19
AI of course it's harder to maintain safety when everything is open but at the same time letting everyone
1:02:25
contribute and using all of the brains in the world for this amazing development yeah now fantastic question
1:02:31
and a complicated one right as you might expect you've actually said that you know you've explained that in your question so up till now uh you as you'll
1:02:39
know like deepmind's pretty much published everything we've done uh uh all our nature science papers and open
1:02:45
sourced Alpha fold and other things I think it's got to be on a case-by-case basis as the systems get more and more
1:02:51
powerful more and more General the problem is if you just open source naively these systems
1:02:56
um Bad actors can whether that's individuals or nation states even can obviously access it militaries and so on
1:03:03
the same as scientists so it's a complicated problem because obviously one would like to do open science and
1:03:09
and and of course things progress much more quickly like that and it's good to get external review of your systems
1:03:16
um but how do you also restrict access to to Bad actors who might want to use it for
1:03:21
um bad means so I don't really have a full solution for that maybe there will have to be more
1:03:27
um access to like individual departments or universities or academics that are
1:03:34
known to be working on the right things perhaps that's one way of doing it with the latest Frontier models or um but
1:03:40
it's not a it's you know this is a current debate that's going on as you're probably well aware of how to balance the risks with
1:03:47
um the benefits of doing that so um you know it's going to be a complicated question we're going to have to try and resolve going forwards the
1:03:53
ideal case I think would be to develop and I would encourage any of you in Academia to be working on this is like
1:03:59
more interpretability analysis of the current systems and we're not doing
1:04:05
enough of that research on that work I would say relative to capability development so that we could develop
1:04:10
evaluation tests for these systems so we can really rigorously know before we release them open source and other
1:04:16
things that they're safe in certain ways what the properties they have so um so they can be perhaps have some guard
1:04:22
rails around them that would be the best right and then you can put them out into the world for people to experiment but
1:04:28
there's a constraint around what can be done with them maybe something like that but the problem is we don't know yet
1:04:34
well enough what those robust evaluation systems should be yet thank you thank you thank you very much
1:04:39
thank you all for your questions as well and your attention today I think we can give them as another round of applause
1:04:46
thanks thank you
1:05:04
