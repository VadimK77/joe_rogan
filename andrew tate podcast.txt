okay so there's a lot of things happening around Angie Tate he just dropped the interview with Tucker Carlson and this is going to be the full
0:06
interview at link you can watch it on this video because this interview was absolutely insane hey guys leave a like
0:12
on the video subscribe and notifications if you haven't already and so you don't miss any updates maybe I just take a look at this Insanity so what are you
0:19
charged with that's a really good question I'm charged with being the head of an organized criminal Group which is
0:25
in charge of recruiting girls to make Tick Tock videos to steal the money from
0:31
The Tick Tock views recruiting girls to make Tick Tock
0:37
videos and stealing the money so it's really a financial crime I it looks that way and it's very interesting because
0:43
the girls who they've identified to add to the file are saying that we're not victims of anything and this isn't true
0:50
but the state believes it's true and the state thinks the I as a 35 year old man
0:56
woke up I was already extremely financially successful I was already a father I was already very well known I
1:01
had no Financial motivation I have no criminal record it's not my personality profile but I woke up the age of 35 and
1:07
decided to make girls do tick tock to enrich myself with the pennies that I
1:14
would earn from Tick Tock views so in the United States the I think the
1:19
belief is that you were charged with human trafficking yeah that's human trafficking because what you do is you force a girl to work against her will
1:25
for financial gain that's human trafficking and their justification for this is that girls do Tick-Tock some
1:31
girls I know who they found who say they're not victims have Tick Tock accounts how do you force someone to do
1:36
Tick Tock videos I guess the prosecutor is gonna have to explain that isn't he uh it's a very interesting scenario I'm
1:41
in and I'm inside of Romania so I have to show a degree of respect to the Romanian judicial system and I have to
1:47
show a degree of respect to the situation I'm in but the overall charge is that there's an organized criminal group there's a group of us I'm the head
1:54
of it my brother is the below me and we use the Loverboy method to convince
2:01
women to do Tick Tock videos to make money so that we can steal the tick tock
2:06
money so there's no just to be clear you are not accused of pandering of pimping
2:12
forcing women to have sex with anybody no not force them to have sex not for not restraining their uh movement not
2:19
stopping them from living a full life but the fact that we are somehow convincing them to have Tick Tock very
2:24
interesting I don't but but there's no actual I'm asking you this because
2:30
I I do think it's a widespread belief that you were accused of pimping yeah well there's nothing to do with any of
2:36
this case absolutely nothing and it's kind of scary because the crime in itself of human trafficking is a unique
2:41
one because they can ignore the statement of the victim so the girls have come forward and said this is insane you've just
2:48
picked us because we're near Andrew and we're as friends but the whole idea of the crime is they can say that she's under she's brainwashed right she's
2:55
under duress so you can ignore her statement state says she's a victim regardless of the fact that she says
3:00
she's not a victim so it's very interesting because the difference between sex and rape is consent right right but they remove all
3:07
of that they're like nope you're a victim no matter what you say we're deciding you're a victim and they've chosen them and of course these girls do
3:13
nothing pornographic they've never had sex with anyone nothing to do with that so they've picked Tick-Tock so it's scary imagine you're a full-grown man
3:19
anywhere in the world today they can find two girls who have tick tock on their phone which is every single female on the planet and they can accuse you of
3:27
forcing them to take the tick tock money and even if the girls say they didn't do that this isn't true then you're still
3:32
uh you're still a human but Force what is that consist of forcing someone to do
3:37
something are they accusing you of using violence or no they're accusing me and this thing they're accusing me of using the lover boy method coercing them by
3:44
being nice though and by the way these charges presumably are public so they're public
3:50
and this is extremely serious but if you actually analyze the overall case against me they're saying that
3:56
Andrew and his brother by being nice men convinced girls to have Tick Tock accounts and then take
4:02
the money and it's very interesting because inside of the entire case File there's not a single financial transaction to us for money
4:09
what are the penalties they're extremely severe five to ten years in jail and
4:14
I've already served coming up now seven months in a form of jail
4:19
um they can only so you are essentially incarcerated right now absolutely I'm on house arrest and that counts as jail you
4:26
can only be held six months without charge I was initially picked up thrown in a
4:31
Cell without charge and I think the intention of the entire investigation at that point was to find the crime because
4:38
they had very very weak evidence they contacted 2 000 people who know me or knew me they tried very hard to convince
4:45
some female somewhere to come forward and say something bad about me the media machine which works hands in hand with
4:50
the Justice machine as you know very well did exactly that in fact they offered bribes effectively they'd call up ex-girlfriends and say if you have
4:56
anything bad to say about Andrew we can pay you fifty thousand dollars for the story and they tried very hard
5:01
they didn't find any evidence of anything uh they then released me on house arrest
5:06
and then two days before the legal limit in which they had to drop everything they charged me with whatever they had
5:12
from the beginning which is very little and now we have to wait for the Romanian judicial system to analyze the file and
5:17
God willing throw it away how long did you spend in jail I was in jail for 92 days in a Romanian jail cell what was
5:24
that like it was certainly uh interesting experience um
5:30
I won't lie and say it was easy it was certainly very difficult the uncertainty of it it's a very uncertain situation to
5:37
be picked up on just before New Year's Eve and throwing in a Cell without charge and I'm asking different prison guards and different prisoners how long
5:43
am I going to be here one person was like I've been here two years I'm like you've been charged she goes yeah but I haven't gone to court yet like
5:49
everyone's been there for years I thought I was going to be there for years and it certainly takes a mental toll on you and and I think jail is a
5:55
different experience when you know you're innocent we're not there's a guy in there for murder he's like yeah I murdered someone I'm in jail you can
6:01
kind your soul and your mind is accept the punishment for a crime but when you actually done nothing wrong I think jail
6:07
is a lot harder did you know why you were there not initially so for about the first two
6:13
weeks I never actually got told in English what I was accused of because I was
6:18
arrested on December 29th there's news what were the circumstances of that yeah December 29th 5 a.m the armed guards ran
6:25
in this house uh they spent all day searching the entire house they're very interested in electronics as most
6:31
federal agencies are and then they put me they took me that evening and said we're going to go and put you in jail
6:36
for 24 hours and after 24 hours you see a judge and the judge will decide if you stay in jail and the judge decided I
6:42
should stay what did you do I mean did you make who'd you call I I had a lawyer and my lawyer came and he said we need
6:48
to analyze the case File we need to see what they have against you you're being accused of human trafficking it's a human trafficking
6:54
that's insane who when what I went to jail and then I was given all
7:00
this paper in Romania I don't speak Romanian although I live here and then I was waiting for the translation so I think it's about two weeks before I
7:06
finally got the papers in English to understand why I was in a jail cell and then I really understood how insane the accusations were what is human
7:12
trafficking yeah so the overall unders my understanding of it they're saying that human trafficking is when you convince a
7:19
woman to do something she doesn't want to do for financial gain and there's different methods you can do that you can do that through force and you can
7:25
also do that through emotional coercion I think most people just speaking from the American perspective most people
7:31
believe that human trafficking is effectively slavery selling human beings
7:36
that's what and that's what I believe as well absolutely and this is the thing that's so interesting when you finally end up the enemy of the Matrix and they
7:43
use the legal system as a weapon to punish you for having an opinion you realize how subjective the law is
7:49
right because it can be a weapon when do you have something subjective you can just pick and choose so if they sit and say ah human trafficking is a woman
7:57
doing something for financial gain against her will via emotional coercion well he knows these two girls they have
8:03
tick-tocks emotional coercion convincing her that's what I'm accused of because they have no proof of me doing anything
8:08
wrong so they said he's convinced these girls to do Tick Tock for money the girls have said themselves have said
8:13
this is not true and the state is denying their statement saying no you're brainwashed it is true
8:20
and I went to jail so how is the state if so the state is trying to coerce the women
8:26
so how is the state not committing human trafficking by the same definition absolutely it's very interesting it's very interesting that you can sit
8:32
someone down and tell them they're a victim when they say they're not a victim you're a victim of being coerced
8:37
and we're going to try to coerce you into conceding your coerce exactly it's a very interesting scenario and uh okay
8:44
yeah and it's a very interesting scenario and I I would and it's up until this point
8:50
no judge has looked at the evidence of the case so up until this point I've been to court a bunch of times but the
8:56
only reason I was in court was to discuss my preventative detention so under Romanian law if you being free can
9:02
impede the investigation you should stay in jail so the judge agreed that yeah
9:08
maybe if he's free he can damage this investigation because they're trying very hard to get something on the sky so I've done a bunch of jail time and now
9:15
it just Begins the judge is going to look at the case and like I said God willing I still have enough faith in the remaining judicial system that she's
9:21
going to look at this and go this is not a crime or you're aware of the media coverage of this however so you're in
9:27
jail for 90 days or more and the rest of the world is talking about you do you know what they're saying they're saying
9:33
very heinous things and I would hate to come across as a conspiracy theorist Tucker but I kind of have a feeling that this might be something to do with my
9:39
influence in an attempt to slander my name perhaps I'm crazy but the fact that they chose such a heinous crime and they
9:44
reported it so heavily and they won't shut up and keep repeating basically a slander attack day after day after day
9:51
also considering the fact that other people who genuinely commit heinous crimes have far more favorable press
9:56
coverage I don't want you to think I'm a conspiracy theorist please Tucker I would hate for you to come here and call me crazy but something very strange
10:02
about it and I think the what when Jeffrey Epstein's friends call you immoral yeah
10:07
the uh the goal of it is certainly to slander my name and I I like to see it
10:12
as a litmus test I like to see it as an intelligence test anybody who wakes up and looks at me and goes he's a human
10:19
trafficker because of tick tock those they're fully gone so but but from the
10:24
way can just defend the average news consumer in the west sure Andrew Tate
10:30
kind of an outlaw lives in some Palace in Romania wherever
10:36
that is and he's been and Romania it sounds like the kind of place where human trafficking is like the main
10:42
industry a lot of it happens here that's what's so crazy about it right what's so crazy is if they really want to find a
10:47
human trafficker I think they could probably do it quite easily but they managed to get me that's certainly the perception
10:53
um but it's it's one of those charges that kind of sells itself oh absolutely and it doesn't matter if you're found
10:58
guilty or not right you're a human trafficker forever and uh but I do think that public Consciousness is changing I
11:04
think with things like the uh there's been some very large court cases recently involving some very
11:09
famous people in which women were caught lying trying to slander men's names for rape and these kinds of things and I
11:16
don't think people believe it anymore but that scares me to a degree because I think that the typical weapon the
11:22
standardized Playbook is now failing and I don't know what the new playbook's going to be it's almost like better the devil you know that you're too famous
11:28
you're too successful we don't like you call him a rapist or a human trafficker put them all over the news slander is named try and wreck his life now that
11:34
nobody believes it what's what's the next move what are they going to try next wouldn't it just have been easier
11:39
to commit like a massive Financial crime and defraud people of billions come up
11:44
with like a fake cryptocurrency call it like I don't know FTX or just give a name to it yep something yes you know
11:51
steal billions yeah and get your parents involved and buy a bunch of real estate in the Bahamas and then like you'd be
11:56
sort of a hero right oh absolutely and I would have certainly made a lot more money than Tick Tock because I don't think Tick Tock even pays you for views
12:03
and if it certainly does I never got a single transaction from so it's a very interesting scenario but if I was
12:09
accused of a financial crime my name would not be slandered no of course well of course not you have the presumption of instance so just back to the to the
12:15
jail thing so you're in with your brother at the beginning I was not but towards the end I was yeah what did you
12:20
do all day it's a good question um I looked at the wall stared at the wall Smoked Cigarettes lots of push-ups
12:28
read the Quran uh you smoke cigarettes did push-ups and read the Quran
12:33
basically yes and certainly had some introspective moments tried my best to get out tried my best
12:40
to buy my small phone calls understand what's happening in the outside world tried to make sure that the people I
12:46
love and care about are taken care of because I'm the man of my family and I'm also the man of
12:51
quite a large I wouldn't say Empire but life and there's a whole lot of people who rely on me you know you have staff
12:57
and families you have children and family feeling yeah so when you're plucked from that it's kind of strange
13:02
you're in jail and you're concerned for yourself but your primary concerns are also all your duties as a man as a man I
13:08
don't want children to starve we've got a whole tribe I've got people to pay so it was very very frustrating
13:14
constantly trying to make sure everybody else else was okay and feeling helpless that's what hurt me the most make I was
13:20
trying to make sure everybody I love and care about was fine and I wasn't as powerful as I should have been and that
13:25
was very upsetting and especially they were going to keep me there for years I was having serious concerns about how I
13:30
can feed the people I love did you ever come to the edge at all no I I certainly had some days I was
13:37
less happy than others but I I made sure that my mindset was built in a way that
13:43
I could always be doing something constructive and also I think you get what you give in life and if I ever felt
13:48
particularly sad on a day I would try very hard to make other people happy because if I made other people smile I'd feel better so even the dinner ladies or
13:56
the prison guards I'd try very hard just to make people smile I know it sounds silly some of the prisoners some of the
14:02
prison guards were more open than others but there was one there was a couple prison guards who were ice cold who didn't want to say a word to me and like
14:08
hey bro your hair looks amazing and you just stare at me like he wants shut up but um I'll just try my best to cheer
14:14
people up to cheer myself up and as a man all you can do is just find the resolve to continue doing the best you
14:19
can in this current circumstance so what were the other prisoners like I don't want to insult Romania in any
14:26
way and I love this country and I chose to live here but if I had to describe it for the people for an American audience
14:33
to understand I don't think Romania and a lot of these countries have the same kind of Mental Health
14:38
set up or the mental health support that a lot of Western Nations have so you end up in jail so I think a lot of there was
14:45
a lot of mental health problems inside the jail so it was very similar it wasn't just a jail there was also a lot of mental health problems in there which
14:51
adds a new complexity and a new dimension to the suffering because there's just random screaming and there's suicide and there's it's
14:58
certainly not a very nice place to be oh so it's it's horrifying yeah I don't want to go back
15:05
you hear the phrase Romanian prison and it sounds tough so it was what you would imagine it is and and when this process
15:12
is over there's a lot more I will say but um I will say the staff were very nice to
15:18
me and I want to make this clear I want to make it very clear that all the staff in the jail were very professional and very nice to me
15:24
I would almost say that they believed that was innocent and they understood that I didn't belong there there was a
15:29
there was a semi-apologetic vibe to the way I was treated by the guards if that
15:35
makes sense yes they understood very well I don't think anybody like I said with a functioning brain believes that
15:40
me at the age of 35 decided to still Tick-Tock money and ruin my entire life without Financial motivation to girls
15:46
who say they're not victims of anything I don't think anybody with a brain well the fact that you're not accused of a
15:51
sex crime or violence which I think most people don't really understand yeah and they can look it up yeah I mean but
15:57
you're not actually accused of rape correct selling anyone correct pimping
16:02
correct okay um that right there raises a lot of questions yeah and and this is the thing
16:08
that's so interesting because I'm accused of using a method of human trafficking called the Loverboy method so how that would traditionally work is
16:14
a man would meet a girl become her boyfriend take her to another country
16:19
turn her into a prostitute say I love you like pimping of course but they're saying because all my
16:26
conversations with these girls are very nice they're saying that I use the Loverboy method to convince them to do Tick Tock
16:31
and once again I never made a penny from Tick Tock and I have no interest in girls tick tocks accounts and I've never made any money from Tick Tock in my life
16:37
so that raises the question so that right there I think I mean we can let people assess I'm not you know an expert
16:42
on the Romanian legal code but that's kind of not the impression that most people have okay and then that's the
16:47
media and that's the media who have made that very very the media have tried very hard to do that and if I had to estimate
16:52
I think that the the overall intention was just to throw me in a cell use the media machine to drum up something real
16:59
I think that's what the the goal was so but what's the and I believe that um it
17:05
seems I mean obviously yeah uh one thing I've never been to Romanian before and one thing I'm struck by is the American
17:10
presence here oh it's massive fully understand that so there are three NATO bases here now they're bustling because
17:16
of the war in Ukraine yeah once on the Black Sea like below Crimea so this is strategically important this country to
17:23
Nato absolutely and um so this is a lot less far away than I
17:29
realized it's much more American influence oh absolutely I think that played a role yeah well
17:35
I think and I don't want to get this incorrect I think it's the second or third biggest U.S embassy in the world
17:40
the U.S embassy here looks like a prison is huge they've got a huge Embassy here and even during chachesco during the
17:46
communism days Romania was an ally of the West even during communism yes so yes Francesca came to New York yes
17:52
that's right yeah so Romania and America have been very good friends for a very long time um
17:58
I have to be careful what I say but it's certainly it's certainly very interesting what's happened to me the American Embassy were not particularly
18:04
helpful let's put it that way they weren't very interested in me being locked up without charge they didn't seem very interested in getting me out
18:10
but you're an American citizen absolutely and uh so you're an American passport holder correct
18:16
um so I think the average American believes perhaps falsely that if you are accused of a crime in a foreign country
18:22
particularly a less developed country like Romania you go to the US Embassy and someone takes an interest in your
18:27
case just to make sure that your treatment Falls within you know accepted standards of Justice yeah they came to
18:34
see me but they're when I was asking them what they can actually do about all of this
18:40
they weren't particularly helpful I don't want to Pedal conspiracy theories and I've heard a lot of
18:46
information Etc but um I wouldn't say they sanctioned it I
18:52
don't know if they had to sanction it but something they weren't particularly interested in getting me out but at least they came to see me more than once
18:58
I mean they kind of pretended to care the UK Embassy didn't even pretend to care the UK Embassy had the UK Embassy
19:05
was I really think they enjoyed it they didn't and you're a British subject as well correct and this is the kind of
19:11
thing and I want to say this here that's kind of frustrating for me because Romania is my home now for seven years but my my I'm half British half American
19:18
originally and when something like this happens to you you have this longing for home you kind of want to go home when
19:24
you end up in a jail in a country where even though you've lived for a long time you don't speak the language you don't understand the legal system going to
19:31
court in a foreign language is far more intimidating than in your own language you don't have a clue what's being said
19:36
you don't how you don't understand how anything works and then you kind of have this longing for home but I feel like my home
19:41
countries hate me and they hate me because of my message which I believe to be a positive message so you kind of have this strange feeling of
19:47
homelessness because it's like well if I go to the UK I believe they're going to attack me the same if I go to America I believe they're going to attack me the
19:53
same so where do you go it's kind of scary where do you go it's a good question
19:58
we're gonna have to see it how did you wind up here I moved to Romania I came to visit a long time ago before anybody ever
20:04
visited Romania I came to visit and I genuinely fell in love with the place it truly is a fantastic country I love
20:09
nature as a amazing nature it's a very safe place has this reputation of being dangerous it's not dangerous it's very
20:15
safe the people are very good the people are very conservative traditionally it's almost like America was 20 30 years
20:21
ago it's gorgeous they have a bunch of nice restaurants and plenty of things to do and I've never had a problem here in
20:26
any way never had any issue with the law or with or with the other side criminals nothing until this came out of nowhere so it's
20:34
been very strange so what is it about your message do you think that
20:40
infuriates certain people well my message traditional my message is traditional masculinity my message is to
20:46
stand up and say what you mean and mean what you say and even going to the gym nowadays is an act of defiance because when you have a man who's built with any
20:53
degree of principle you say no to things and I think if I have to analyze my message and why I'm so disliked by the
20:59
people who dislike me it's not the things I'm saying it's the fact that if you adhere to my principles and you adhere to the things I say you end up
21:05
being the kind of person who will resist certain ideas you say no what kind of man never says no name a man who never
21:12
says no men say no right men men wake up and say no I don't think that should be done this way no my children will not be
21:18
taught that no father's primary job absolutely So when you say to men listen you're allowed to have an opinion you're
21:25
allowed to have standards you're allowed to have boundaries and barriers you're allowed to get up and become important and work hard and try hard and become
21:31
the kind of man who can't be controlled then you're seen as an enemy and I especially with the massive influence
21:36
I've gained I think they look at me and go ah he's he's helping men resist to slave
21:41
programming we don't need him around we need to empty their brains so we can inject the slave programming and
21:47
convince men to be eunuchs because once you're eunuched then you're not a threat I think I buy that because your message
21:54
I I'm not the world's expert on your message but I've seen a lot of it
21:59
and it's not explicitly political actually no it's not political at all and their original attack before this
22:05
Matrix attack is a weaponized virtue which is what they usually do there's no genuine virtue inside of these people
22:10
they weaponize virtue they find a virtue and they turn into a bullet and they shoot at you I'm sure you know very well
22:15
yeah I've heard yeah I was a misogynist for the longest time just for saying that men should have
22:21
standards if you if you tell a man he could have standards in a relationship in any way you're a misogynist it's
22:27
actually very interesting because what does that mean to have standards in a relationship but this is the thing that's so interesting about it because they've gendered the argument when I
22:33
never did I said as a man you shouldn't have a girlfriend who's a liar and a cheater and you also shouldn't have male
22:39
friends who are liars and cheers you shouldn't be around dishonest people yes male or female men and they and they
22:44
gendered it and said ah he's a misogynist he's saying that men should only act this way with women Etc I said
22:51
that men should have standards and you should have protocols that you're prepared to accept and you should have hard parameters and if a woman doesn't want to adhere to those parameters
22:57
that's her decision and it's her prerogative but you don't have to stay with her why should you what's wrong with that
23:03
well that's teaching men to say no they don't want men to say no so are you arguing that it's better to be with a
23:08
virtuous woman I think so yes I know that's no I'm serious I don't want to I don't wanna that seems
23:15
like good advice I don't want to come across as extreme but yes I am and what's actually funny is I really
23:20
believe most of the things I'm saying were accepted by absolutely everybody 15 years ago 10 years ago and now it's
23:26
Public Enemy Number One and it's because of the mass influence I have at one point I became the most Googled man on
23:31
Earth at one point and it's a scary situation if you're arguing that it's really
23:37
important for a man to find a good woman yeah a decent woman an honest woman yep that's that's the truest thing that's
23:44
ever been said absolutely that's the most important thing any man can do I mean I can just tell you firsthand oh thank you very much married 32 years
23:50
that's the most important thing and you think saying that angered people absolutely because I'm arguing the only
23:55
way to do that is via masculine Excellence I'm saying in the world we live in today it's hyper competitive and if you want to be the kind of man that
24:02
has the choice of women to choose a good one you need to be an excellent man it's no longer acceptable for you to just be
24:08
an average Joe or below average you have to get up and you have to work hard and you have to be smart and interesting and
24:13
you have to be charismatic and make some money and be in good shape and you have to try very hard and unfortunately for
24:19
them if you follow that path as a man and you become successful in those Realms you end up being the kind of
24:24
person who resists enslavement you become the kind of person who wakes up and says no I don't believe in that that
24:29
doesn't make sense I can't imagine a better message than that if you want a good Society so then you have to argue
24:35
and sit and say do these people want a happy functioning Society or do they want something else what do you think
24:42
I think that I would never kill myself and I also just throwing that out there
24:48
and I also think that when you when you want to conquer a society you
24:53
kill the military age males that's what you do that's the first thing they've ever done they walk in and all the men have to have their throats cut they
25:00
can't perhaps do that but they can certainly cut your balls off and then you can't resist and I think there's
25:05
certainly a movement to ensure that there's very little resistance left inside of the number one demographic
25:11
which is required to resist oppression which are military aged males and they don't want those kind of people waking
25:17
up with any kind of self-respect or standards or to say no I don't accept this I do not need a ninth injection
25:23
they don't want that they want you to sit and say hmm I don't need it but the news said so so oh well so in the one
25:31
interview that you and I did you had a line that I've been thinking about ever since I thought it was so interesting I
25:37
never thought of it before you said that a lot of people went along with the vax yep and that you didn't judge them
25:43
because facts change but now that we know that a lot of what we were told was wrong and some of it was a lie
25:50
it is a requirement of your own Dignity of your own self-respect to say so
25:55
completely and people should apologize I really do believe and I have nothing against the people who fell for the
26:00
propaganda NFL for the programming yeah yes I agree fine but you should wake up and say I was fooled I've learned my lesson I will not be
26:07
fooled again but if you were fooled by the MSM and took the injection and you continued to be fooled and you've not
26:13
self-reflected and you have not realized that they lied to you the entire way and you now believe the new bunch of lies are all over the television and there's
26:18
something wrong with you or you don't care that you were allowed to you don't care that you were lied to because
26:24
I think a lot of this is actually genuinely cowardice I think it's a very easy world view the life is easier if
26:31
you accept the news tell us the truth yes everything they want me to believe is true everything's nice and simple
26:36
Good Guys bad guys and if you want to actually wake up it takes a degree of Bravery because then
26:42
you have to destroy your entire world view everything you've ever understood and everything you're told and you have to really look at the world and go oh this is a mess
26:49
and that takes bravery and once again that's why they don't want men to be brave they want you to sit there and go
26:54
oh it's easier if just you know CNN said so it must be true and it's cowardice
26:59
and they're trying to instill cowardice in all of us that's what they're they're trying very hard to do and I think even
27:06
just me as a person the people who hate me my detractors who dislike me so much even if I say nothing
27:12
I just turn up big bald strong fast car but you know it's just me I'm like the
27:19
enemy to them because I symbolize men who don't comply and not don't
27:25
comply you know in a negative law breaking way but don't comply enough if we don't agree with that or we don't see
27:31
common sense in that we're going to politely Decline and that's simply not allowed what's it like to have the prospect of prison hanging over you
27:39
I think that I like to believe that this is a test from God
27:46
I like to believe that if you become the most Googled man in the world for saying that you have mental resilience that God
27:52
is gonna make sure you don't have that degree of Fame without testing you I like to believe that God comes along
27:58
and says yes I've allowed you to become to top G we're going to see if you really are the top G I believe that's
28:04
how the world works it's certainly intimidating especially knowing you're completely innocent
28:09
but I believe it's a test and I believe it's my job to pass the test for my ancestors and for people watching over
28:14
me and for God and I think I have to do the absolute best I can possibly do in the scenario and the circumstance regardless of whether I win or lose I
28:20
still believe I'm going to win because I've seen the case File and I've seen that no laws have been broken but even in the very unfortunate circumstance
28:26
that this Matrix attacks goes deep enough to throw me into a jail cell I think I should handle it like a man I
28:32
think I should stay and finish the process and I should walk with my head held high and suffer as much as I need
28:38
to suffer to stick by my convictions and know that I'm an innocent person and
28:44
I refuse to break I refuse to cry I refuse to be depressed about it I'm going to wake up and I'm going to smile
28:50
regardless and regardless of what happens to me I want everyone to know that one I would never kill myself and two I
28:57
think that as a man there's always going to be a degree of pain and suffering in your journey I don't think you're ever going to become a successful man or be
29:03
good at being a man without pain and suffering and there's many times in my life where
29:09
something terrible happened to me and at the time if I could change it I would have but retrospectively you kind of look back and go you know what that was
29:14
formulative for me that's right that is what God decided I needed to become who I became
29:20
so all of the pain and all the suffering I've ever gone through in my life ended up in the end building me into the person I am and I'm proud of who I am so
29:26
if God decides I need to go back to a Romanian dungeon for however many days then all I can do is accept it and
29:32
accept his plan and accept it it's gonna make me a better person and so you see the hand of God in your life absolutely
29:37
I think that he's the best of planners and
29:42
like I said if you if you retrospectively analyze all the times in life you wish you could have changed
29:48
things yes he knew better and I'm gonna have to accept that when did you conclude that
29:55
I think I guess I always kind of knew I was atheistic for a while when I was younger but as you get older you start
30:00
to look at the world and understand that the thing for me was actually I guess a scientific principle was Newton's law of
30:07
equal and opposite Force if there is evil in the world and I'd like to think we both agree there certainly is yes
30:12
there has to be an equal and opposite Force which is good and I would like to think of that as God even the idea of
30:18
God as a notion even just as a concept if that idea of God resists evil then
30:25
God is real if you have two islands you have two people let's say a ship crashes and you have two people who swim to two
30:31
different islands and one Island they're atheists Savages and they rip you apart and the other Island you get there and
30:37
they believe in God and they believe they're not allowed to kill you even just their idea of God God saved your life
30:42
so I think even just the concept of God in and of itself if enough people believe and it makes them do good then God must be true and that's the equal
30:47
and opposite Force to the evil of the world and this is how I I view it so I don't see how anybody with a conscience cannot
30:54
believe in God anymore that's such a profoundly different world
30:59
view from the one that we're presented with I think that do you think that's
31:04
maybe the division in the west between people who who see those forces at work and and those who I I think the main I
31:12
think the West is actually split between people who think in people who don't think at all I think the people there there are
31:19
there's no such thing as these two opposing World Views I think people believe there's worldview a and world view b i I disagree with that I think
31:25
there's worldview a the good guys which are primarily people who do believe in God do have parameters
31:30
do believe in standards do believe in self-respect do know how to say no and there's world view B which Changes Day
31:37
by Day regard based on what they're told which means they have no real world view at all they just repeat and they have no
31:44
standards and they have no parameters there's nothing you can tell them that will make them wake up and go that's wrong because they have no inherent
31:51
morality so you can literally you could say bestiality is accepted and
31:56
encouraged now it's good for you because for climate change and they'll sit there and go ah for climate change oh well off
32:02
we go and uh they'll just do it so I think you have a camp of people who who think
32:07
and you have a camp of people who repeat and I don't think there's actually the opposing side to the good I don't think
32:14
function as a thinking populace at all I think they simply repeat
32:19
it feels like there's I mean the conflict between those two groups is getting more intense it's certainly
32:25
getting more intense and I
32:30
it was interesting for me because and I want to be an optimist but I lost so much faith in humanity
32:36
during covet I really if you would have told me how covid would have gone down yes before
32:42
covet I'd say no way we're not that bad you know like I thought the people aren't that dumb
32:49
but when I experienced covid it's actually scary you see how the Nazis managed to do what they did you see how
32:55
they managed to put people in concentration camps you see it and I had a very unique view of covet
33:00
because in the first days of covid when people were falling over in China and the Italian hospitals were overrun at
33:07
the height of the panic when most people believed because it was the very beginning early stages my brother and I
33:13
had a very logical conversation and said we're two military-aged men in very good physical condition if we die of this the world's over if it can kill us it's
33:20
zombie apocalypse so why are we gonna live in fear so we found the only two countries that were open which were
33:26
Sweden and Belarus we had just been to Belarus this is before the Ukraine war we'd just been
33:31
there we decided to try Sweden so for the first three months of covid during the height of lockdowns when when
33:37
Florida was closed when it was absolutely I remember yeah when it was the craziest lockdowns globally me and
33:42
Tristan are in Sweden in absolute freedom they had no restrictions no masks no vaccine passports no social
33:49
distancing nightclubs or full lunch restaurants are open Perfectly complete normal society nobody talks about this
33:56
anymore nobody talks about ways Sweden never did a thing everything functioned perfectly fine the entire time and they
34:03
don't have it where's their Mass where's their illness of severe their winter of severe illness and death yes they never
34:08
had one it's cold country never had one so we were living in Sweden living completely normal lives seeing everyone
34:15
seeing the internet and seeing this insane we're like well surely if we just put up a few videos of us partying in
34:20
Sweden in nightclubs this will wake people up people didn't want us people ignored their own eyes that's the scariest thing
34:27
about everything is that they can get to a level where with the media machine where people will genuinely ignore their own eyes I don't
34:34
understand how you can get people so brainwashed that they will see that the sky is blue and then they'll watch that the sky is green and then they'll look
34:41
at it again and go Sky's green it's crazy to me but covet proves they
34:46
can do that and uh that's why the the war is getting so intense because the principled people
34:52
are saying how can you still believe in the things that you're saying here is all the logical empirical evidence that
34:59
that is a lie but these people are ideologically brainwashed and they don't want to take enough
35:04
they don't have The Bravery it takes to wake up and accept that they're being lied to so they'd rather just to the End of Time repeat what they're told and it
35:12
becomes more and more intense as it becomes more and more ridiculous that's so scary as it becomes more and
35:17
more ridiculous the more intense both sides get yes right so what the future holds I'm not entirely sure but I like
35:24
to believe even my current charges I found solace when I was in jail that the thinking people are looking at
35:30
this going something about this doesn't seem right well I mean it it is a little bracing I mean when I discovered I mean
35:37
I was sympathetic to you already um but you know man's accused of human trafficking it's worth finding out what
35:43
he's accused of and when I discovered that there was no like actual human trafficking charge yeah you know that's
35:50
not actually human trafficking I don't care what you call it yep you weren't buying it even accused of buying and selling anyone then the next conclusion
35:57
you inevitably reach is they don't like the guy they don't like his views which is fine they're going to send them to jail for
36:03
that yep that does seem like an escalation absolutely but
36:08
if they don't like your views and you're inspiring millions of people to resist slave programming you become a threat
36:14
like they disgust me but you can't send a guy to jail because you disagree with him you shouldn't but even before I went
36:19
to jail the members of parliament in the UK were talking about me and what a dangerous role model I am for young boys
36:26
so they launched this initiative inside of British schools to ban me my name can't be said inside of any British
36:33
school and members of parliament were standing up in Parliament saying Andrew Tate is dangerous he's encouraging young
36:39
boys to have misogynistic views because I'm literally telling young men to go to the gym and to stand up for themselves and believe believe in themselves and
36:45
believe in something and by extension you look at some of the sexual education books these children
36:51
are being given which I believe in age nine I don't think a child needs to learn about anal
36:57
sex or any of these things probably not yeah probably not so they're pushing that to the children but I'm banned
37:02
well they're also pushing weed in video games on boys oh completely and you can listen to rap music about killing people
37:07
all day long and there's a whole and little Nas he can he can have sex with the devil in his music videos that's
37:13
fine but I'm dangerous for saying go to the gym and once I realized what was scary to me is I I said this to my
37:19
brother I said once the parliament is discussing you you're basically considered a national security threat at
37:25
this point you're a threat to National Security at that level and then all bets are off right if what about the UK so
37:31
the UK has become more authoritarian than anywhere in the Persian Gulf correct
37:37
how did that happen yeah um and and it's like I said it's very interesting because people still
37:43
the people on can't be who don't think a lot of them believe that the law
37:49
is fair I've had people say to me oh yeah what they're doing to you is garbage you need a lawyer so yeah I do
37:55
need a lawyer and I do have a lawyer thank you but it's not that simple unfortunately you know it's a very the
38:01
law is very subjective and uh if they want to attack you with it they're going to do a very good job of attacking you with it and and that's
38:08
what the UK does the UK have these laws which are extremely subjective and they can use it as a weapon to
38:14
basically silence anyone they decide I mean England is the birthplace of free speech
38:21
habeas corpus of kind of framework of liberal democracy that we thought we believed in yeah and now it's a country
38:29
where people are arrested for praying while we what happened good question and
38:34
there's a saying that I heard and I don't know who said it but he said that a sick country adopts laws like a dying
38:41
man will try medicine and I think that the UK is failing in real time if you look at it in any
38:47
metric whether it's living standards whether it's crime rate any any metric you can measure the success of a country
38:53
by it's fallen off the cliff it's becoming more and more expensive to live there the education system's gone down the pan London is the stabbing capital
39:01
of the world you're not safe to leave your house so their answer to this is just more and more and more laws and
39:06
unfortunately as they do that they're not even intelligent enough to actually attack the people who are doing genuinely bad to the world they just
39:12
make more and more authoritarian laws and they end up using them to attack the people that the government doesn't like and I ended up being one of them and
39:18
I think Europe in general has problems if you look at France as we speak I think it's on fire isn't it most of it
39:24
it is yeah so um they have issues and their answer what is it what's a government's
39:30
solution to anything law what what can a government do no matter what they're not laws that are aimed at
39:37
fixing the problem that's right their laws aimed at talk at fixing the person
39:43
who's talking about the problems so why don't you get rid of the guy who tells everybody isn't that easier Tucker
39:50
well I fix any of this if we just shut him up they won't know no but that's like responding to a heat wave by
39:56
breaking your thermometer completely right it's like that that's that's the plan plan one is to break the
40:03
thermometer we might deal with the heat wave a bit later but get air conditioning no we expect the thermometer for now there's too many
40:09
people talking about the heat wave so let's just break that and then later on maybe when we have time we'll do
40:15
something about the actual issue it does seem like a lot of this is an effort not
40:21
to talk about the thing the real thing in Europe anyway which is migration yeah and the UK formerly known as England and
40:30
France have both been completely changed by people from other countries yep and
40:36
you know I'm sure I've added good things too I mean I'm not you know but um but they've changed them and in general
40:41
they're not better countries and like why can't anyone admit that but this is what's really interesting to me about what's happening because we're talking
40:46
about masculinity and men who say no And Men Who stand up but there has to be balance right
40:52
everywhere in the world there has to be power balances if there's not a balance in power there's going to be a vacuum and that's going to be filled if you
40:58
neuter the native population of men if you destroy their mentality to resist if you tell them that every single thing
41:04
about the masculine is wrong and you basically feminize and you communicate them turn them into Unix and then you
41:10
import high testosterone men from the third world who don't believe any of this garbage who grew up in a society
41:15
where they understand the only way to succeed is to be a fearsome predator to a degree what do you think is going to happen
41:21
like who's supposed to protect the sanctity of these nations and and these
41:27
settlements and these towns and Villages the police no in general I would argue
41:32
that it's the masculine Essence that can be detected by the people who arrive I guarantee if you were to pick up a
41:40
bunch of these migrants in Sarajevo or Moscow they behave themselves oh yeah I have a
41:46
feeling they just look around and go not today but but when you but when you knew
41:51
or the native populists then it's like well there's a power vacuum and when and when there's a power vacuum what do we
41:56
expect to happen so that's what are the French gonna do about it what's your average Englishman gonna do about
42:02
nothing nothing and and that's the thing and and that makes you wonder is this purposeful like why these two things are
42:09
these two actions of neutering the native populace and importing these high
42:14
testosterone third worlders are so at odds with each other is this purposeful
42:19
I'm not sure but has anyone considered this so yeah it's interesting because you talk about these are huge and
42:25
intentional Trends and so and I mean they're trans they're historically transformative Trends they're a big deal
42:31
and so they're probably not happening by accident right there's got to be some intent how could there not be that's
42:36
right and and how do they expect all of this to end and this is exactly what's happening with migration the problem with migration is specifically is that
42:43
there's no native masculine populace to enforce any degree of culture or boundary or parameter and like I said I
42:48
I would argue the point and I and I've been to Sarajevo and I've been to Moscow I've been to these places and I've seen
42:54
there's a whole bunch of migration and everybody seems to just behave a little bit differently and I think that's because people understand
42:59
that meant that men live here that men live here if if you turn up in someone's house and their house is pristine you're
43:07
probably going to take your cup and you're going to go put it in the kitchen but if you turn up in somebody's house and it's a mess and nobody respects the house and nobody
43:14
cares and the man is drugged out of his mind half asleep on the couch what are you gonna do with your cup you're gonna leave it there you don't give a if
43:20
you turn up to the Western World look at then you're gonna hit on his wife absolutely so what what do we expect to happen in these scenarios right
43:27
and and it is purposeful and it is scary that even me just telling men to go to the gym is seen as an act of defiance to
43:33
the point where I have to be punished I must go to jail I must be silenced thermometer must be broken
43:39
if at the end of all of this no matter what happens do you plan to stay in Romania I love Romania I love this country
43:46
and if I am found not guilty I will stay in Romania yeah I will still stay here I don't believe in running away
43:52
I also believe and perhaps this is yeah I didn't even want to ask you that because legal case pending but I mean
43:58
presumably you're rich enough to run away when you have it correct I'm not going anywhere I think if I was anywhere in the Western
44:03
World this would have happened to me I don't think this is Romania's fault let's put it that way I don't think this is Romania's fault I think if I resided
44:10
in Switzerland or France or Italy the same thing would happen from knowing what I know I think was going to happen to me regardless and
44:16
I think I do have a large amount of sympathy especially amongst the Romanian population I'm I get
44:22
thousands of messages a day from Romanians apologizing to me I think the people here actually like me
44:28
my waiter at lunch yesterday is one of them because he wanted you to know yeah wow amazing this is what I mean everyone understands what's happening my problem
44:35
is not with Romania I don't hold any personal grudges against Romania I think that this Matrix attack was going to come to me what is the Matrix
44:43
good question I guess some Americans call it the Deep state but I like to look at it in a more
44:48
Global way when I say the Matrix I think there are certain agendas which are being pushed I think the media machine
44:54
in the Judicial Systems of the world work together hand in hand I think the goal is to control people's minds to a
45:01
point where they don't discuss anything that's important the reason I use the Matrix is because I've watched that
45:06
movie a few times and has so many similarities to the have you seen the movie no you've never seen the movie The Matrix no I don't watch any movie
45:15
camera no I'm very um dyslexic and it's hard for me to watch video God honestly understood but there's so many
45:21
similarities and the basic premise is that humans minds are controlled and put inside of a false reality so that their
45:27
body heat can be manifested for the machines and I don't think it's much different to reality our minds are
45:33
controlled we're putting a false version of reality we're told things aren't true we're arguing over things that don't matter we're observing a false version
45:39
of events and the goal of it is just to distract us long enough for our bodies to be used for the machines to Solace
45:44
and I think it's pretty similar pretty similar striking similarities and even then there's a bunch of other
45:50
similarities which are difficult for me to explain you haven't watched a movie but there are agents inside of the Matrix
45:55
and the idea of the agent the purpose of the agent is to make sure that nobody understands how the Matrix really works
46:01
and to wake anybody's mind up they want to keep you asleep and any person can become an agent at
46:06
any time if they're not unplugged if their mind is not free they can become an agent and their job is to keep you asleep and you see agents all the time
46:13
covid awoken me to agents when I would sit and talk to somebody and they seem perfectly rational and normal until I
46:19
mentioned kovid and then they'd fully change no it's dangerous no what do you
46:24
mean what do you mean are you crazy my grandma got sick and they and they became an agent instantly started
46:29
repeating the news to me and I was like your grandma got sick how old is she 97
46:35
interesting oh I better lock myself in my house then dumbass so um
46:41
agents exist and the Matrix exists and I think most people's most people's version of the world is a false one the
46:49
idea and the world that most people have in their mind and how Society functions and how all these things function I
46:55
genuinely believe is completely false I think they've all been lied to it I don't think anybody understands how any of these of the world works and I try
47:01
and use some very simple you know very simple analogies to wake people up
47:06
I said to one of my friends once I said if me and you could play video games
47:12
for ten thousand dollars and you could cheat would you cheat
47:18
no I was like if I was whooping your ass and it was 10 grand a game and you could cheat would you cheat he goes yeah I was
47:25
like all right so you think you accept that people cheat to win in a video game for a menial amount of money you think
47:31
they're not gonna cheat for something that matters yeah I think so we're not gonna cheat for something important
47:36
you understand what I'm saying oh yeah yeah so um how about to get the most important job in the world president of
47:42
the United States I would never kill myself oh each other over insurance fraud you
47:49
don't think right yeah yeah you know so when you actually understand how the world really works you know it was really interesting
47:56
I remember uh there was this big military coup in was it Myanmar or Burma one of these there's a big military coup
48:02
like a year ago or something and nobody really cared they mentioned on the news a little bit I looked at it
48:07
and I looked into it and they were talking about how the two political parties were almost 50 50 and then in
48:14
the 90s something changed and now one political party Just Smokes the other one and the military took over to
48:20
restore democracy and all this stuff it's very interesting to vote in machines they used interesting uh something to look into
48:28
a lot of countries like that Philippines also true why do you think um support for the war in Ukraine
48:36
support for Ukraine side in the war against Russia support for a war against Russia in the West
48:41
is kind of the the bottom line issue for the people who run the US government and for the American Media why I mean you I
48:48
guess you could argue about it yeah but there isn't an argument about it in the United States there's a position and
48:54
anyone who doesn't hold it is attacked and punished why why is that so important well the first thing I think
49:01
we should all do is I think we should all give Putin credit for curing covet right
49:06
because when his invasion happened copen went away so you thought about that think about it
49:12
it's almost to the day so we have to give him some credit at least for doing that like maybe the bad guy of the world but at least he could
49:17
covert for everybody nearly instantly Fair thank you thank you President Putin
49:23
um yeah I up until this point never really commented too heavily on politics
49:29
yes but I understand very well I like to believe what's happening with Ukraine
49:34
and Russia and what I will say to the people who are watching this at home is that if you are
49:40
naive enough to believe that there are good guys and bad guys in wars and it's as simple as good and bad and that the
49:48
bad guys are crazy and the good guys want freedom they need to do a little
49:53
bit more investigation into what's really happening and when you look at the vested interest of any country or
49:59
any person can I just ask you to pause and just comment that's the truest thing what you just said that is that and anyone who doesn't understand that
50:06
should shut the up and I mean it having seen War anyone who's telling you
50:12
that it's Churchill versus Hitler is an idiot complete well I'll give an
50:17
example when my father was still alive my father excuse me yeah no it's true well my father was still alive
50:23
my father died six or seven years ago I was a lot younger the war at Afghanistan was going on he died six or seven years ago how old was
50:29
he 56. oh gosh yeah he died but um the war in Afghanistan was going on
50:35
and I remember asking my dad saying why do the Taliban even fight and resist the American war machine they don't stand a
50:40
chance like why are these terrorists even fighting against the American War Machine and my dad said they're fighting for
50:48
their way of life they want their wife and they want their children and they want their society and their language
50:53
and they don't want Pride flags and they don't want American and they don't want to be told what to do and they're fighting to be a culture and be
50:59
a people which is independent in and of itself like they're not the bad guys you think they are they're people who are like why are you here what do you want
51:05
we don't agree with that that's against our holy book off right so even there's no such thing as
51:12
good and bad in any war and and who is your father my father was a chess master
51:18
uh he worked for the CIA when he was he was a linguist for the CIA and then he was uh American American
51:25
he was discharged and uh for a story I won't tell but um he was a
51:30
chess master and he it's very interesting I encourage people to look at his Twitter he still has Twitter at Tate terrific
51:38
and everything he was talking about 11 years ago is so important now 11 years
51:44
ago no one cared about we had the dawn bass in 2014. people yes people cared a bit but he was literally he predicted
51:51
the future to you want to see how chess players can see the future read his Twitter everything from lgbtq why they
51:57
need your kids because they can't have their own to the war that's coming and how Europe's gonna have an energy crisis to the letter it's all on his Twitter
52:04
it's amazing to read it's like you could tell the future ten years ago no one talked about any of this stuff did he live in the U.S yes yeah he lived in
52:10
America fascinating yeah it's crazy but he was telling me about a lot of this stuff even when I was a lot younger and as we
52:16
said there's no good guys and bad guys but when do you have a vested interest in something I think that people are
52:23
relatively simple you're talking about why the American American government has such a vested interest in this war which
52:29
is not good for America which is not good for America so is it well we can say it's for money or we can say it's for power
52:34
what else would it be for what is it really for freedom and democracy well I think that's already been destroyed by
52:40
zielinski hasn't it so what is it for if it's not for money and power and uh
52:46
then you say well who's the money and the power going to these are logical conversations it's a
52:51
very logical thought process you know wouldn't it be interesting to say okay I woke up I'm an American
52:57
I would never kill myself I woke up I'm an American why does America care well I guess it's for money
53:04
or power there's no other reason okay well America wants to be a rich powerful country that's fine is the money and
53:09
power going to America or is it going to a select few individuals
53:14
are those select individuals interested in me in my life do they care about benefiting me do I need to support the
53:20
power grab of these select few individuals is that going to be a smart move for me to make for me to have the best possible Human Experience this is a
53:27
very logical thought process people don't seem to think anymore they believe that there's a good guy and
53:33
there's a bad guy and one guy's one team's completely good and one team's completely bad one team's crazy
53:40
they often use the word crazy because to be completely bad you have to be crazy right so you're crazy he's crazy just
53:45
for no reason less it's insane I don't know if you saw
53:50
lukashenko with the BBC did you ever see that interview no oh brother please watch it the way he destroys the
53:57
BBC I thought I did the best job but he I take second place amazing amazing but um yeah and and you
54:04
just have to be critically thinking and then after your critically thinking you have to be brave enough
54:09
and this is the real pandemic of the world as cowardice you have to be brave enough to look around you and realize ah
54:15
everything was a trick everything was alive but why not be a coward I mean it's just a lot easier right well it
54:21
used to be this is the thing that's interesting I would actually argue in the 1950s and 60s if you were to agree with every single narrative and obey
54:26
every single law and do exactly what you were supposed to do and pay your taxes Etc you at least get a wife who
54:32
respected you you'd at least have children who go to school without being indoctrinated to a degree you could have a nice house you could have a pickup
54:39
truck you could have a pretty good life if you just followed the rules yes I
54:45
don't think that's true anymore I think that if you were a man especially and this is what I talk about I talk about masculine issues if you're a man who was
54:51
born and you decide to do exactly as you're told you're going to end up depressed in debt working a job that you
54:58
hate with a wife who doesn't respect you with kids who don't listen to you in a house you don't own until you she leaves you and then you
55:06
contemplate suicide a while and maybe you might find some purpose towards the end enough to survive and pay your taxes
55:12
and then you're gone I don't think a man who just follows the programming is going to find any happiness but they
55:18
don't care why would they they have no interest in masculine happiness there's another thing that's very interesting they talk about men's mental health all
55:24
the time especially in the UK I'm not sure about America but in the UK they have this big drive for men's mental health saying that men commit more
55:30
suicides a lot more a lot more because it's hard to be a man we commit more suicides we're more depressed we have
55:36
all these mental health problems I come along I genuinely get thousands of emails a day saying I'm helping people
55:41
men's mental health but no can't can't help it the way Andrew wants you can't tell him to go to the gym and stand up
55:46
for themselves and have pride what kind of man is going to have a solid mentality and not have mental health issues if he has no Pride
55:52
it's part of being a man part of being a man is proud of yourself if you wake up and you're not proud of who you are and how you look and the things you say how
55:58
are you ever going to have a solid mentality so when I teach things that genuinely help men's mental health
56:03
that's outlawed no you're not allowed to do that instead you have to take our version which is to pretend to care about men's mental health but not give a
56:10
give them a life they know they're not going to enjoy pay taxes and die and men are the backbone medicate them and
56:17
medicate them medicate them long enough to keep working the same way as we medicate farm animals it's a bunch of injections yeah just keep keep them
56:23
alive long enough to get the milk milk's gone chop the head off boom they need to put you in prison
56:29
they're trying yeah why they're trying and and it's and it's
56:36
scary a lot of people but then what do I do I just shut up no you don't think so
56:44
no you can't shut up I mean because in the end your self-respect your dignity is the only thing that's right and this
56:51
this is what people don't understand people say Andrew why are you fighting this war and they don't understand that war is certain
56:57
you either fight war against Injustice and you fight war against the things you know that are wrong and you feel good inside of yourself or you accept the
57:03
slave programming and fight a war with your own mind you have to fight something yes I can shut up and believe what I'm told in the
57:09
news but then I won't why am I so unhappy all the time why am I depressed why does my life suck why does my woman
57:15
ignore me why do my children not respect me you're fighting a war then you're fighting a war with your own mind I'd
57:20
Rather Have All of Me on side and fight against what I know it's genuinely evil you can't escape the
57:25
battle the battle is here for all of us so I've made my decision and that's why I can't be quiet because you just said I would
57:31
lose my self-respect I'd lose my dignity and I don't think I can function that way as a man and I don't think any man
57:37
should be able to function without self-respect and dignity the reason men died on the Titanic was for self-respect and dignity they went into the icy cold
57:43
water and died because they would feel honorless if they jumped on the boat and left the women to die that's right so
57:49
when you have self-respect and dignity you have a hard parameter and you'll do things that which are deemed crazy or insane because you believe in them and
57:56
you stick up for yourself and that's why they don't want men to have self-respecting dignity rather be a free man in your grave absolutely so um I
58:01
can't be quiet and I'm gonna say what I believe is true and I genuinely believe I'm helping the world I think that any
58:08
young man who is a follower of mine I will argue there's no influencer on the
58:13
planet besides me who is genuinely benefiting their life I know you're not big on the internet I look at these
58:19
other streamers and these other influencers they play video games all day they smoke weed on stream they talk
58:24
garbage it's a bunch of drama back in fourth like girls I'm the only influencer or streamer who's genuinely
58:29
talking about making money because you need to have money to escape the matrix it's very hard to resist enslavement when you have to pay the bills
58:35
getting physically strong because a strong body is a strong mind standing up for yourself self-motivation all these
58:41
things I'm talking about genuinely positive things very few people are and I think that is an extremely important message that needs to be told
58:47
and I'm not going to stop doing it because I know I'm genuinely helping the world and they're going to try and punish me for
58:53
it for the rest of my life I think I think this is just beginning and I think when I beat this case which I believe I
58:58
will be I think something else is going to come and it's kind of scary because
59:04
I am a little bit afraid and a little bit intimidated by the incompetence of my enemy because their
59:10
standardized Playbook is now failing in real time the standardized Playbook is the media attack the LIE
59:15
and it's not working anymore and it got me a little bit worried about what the next move is you used to just be able to
59:21
lie about guy over the news and you win right but now it's like shut up so now what I don't know
59:28
um and that's what's kind of scary in my in my scenario because nobody's going to believe in any of the crap they print about me nobody believes it nobody
59:34
believes it whenever I do an interview with the Matrix media they don't nobody believes they have to turn the comments off because level in the comments are
59:40
just ripping them apart well you do seem very sad on the verge of killing yourself are you absolutely not really no I never would and and that's what you
59:47
said that I know I have to keep saying it I have to keep saying it because it's it's scary right
59:53
but I believe you get three lives I think they cancel you initially and then when that fails they try and
59:59
put you in jail without a reason and if that fails there's only one option left after that's right so it's I'm in a very
1:00:05
scary scenario but I guess the same as Demand on the Titanic just couldn't get on the Lifeboat I just can't stop saying
1:00:12
what I believe to be true a young man comes to me and says he's depressed I'm going to tell him how to become a kind of man who's proud of himself and if
1:00:18
that makes him the kind of person that resists slave in slave programming I'm always going to be Public Enemy
1:00:23
Number One you've said depression isn't real or it's not as the way we describe
1:00:31
depression isn't accurate what do you think of depression when I say depression isn't real what I'm
1:00:36
that really upset the world especially the Liberals because they all live on medication right when I say depression
1:00:42
isn't real I'm saying that because I don't believe in things that can take away power from me if I believed in
1:00:47
depression I would have been depressed in jail but I can't be depressed if I don't believe in it if you don't believe in
1:00:52
ghosts how could you be haunted you have two people in a haunted house one believes in ghosts one doesn't
1:00:58
there's a knock in the night one wakes up calls an exorcist is terrified looks for a ghost the other guy doesn't
1:01:04
believe in ghosts knock in the night goes back to sleep it's the belief in the ghost that gives
1:01:11
it the power if I don't believe in depression I believe in feeling depressed sure we're
1:01:16
humans we have emotions sometimes we feel depressed sometimes we feel happy I don't believe in the idea of becoming a
1:01:22
depressed person who has depression I don't believe in that I don't think that's possible for me so if I don't
1:01:28
believe in it how can I happen I don't believe in depression so why would I not adopt the mindset that makes me the most capable Predator I can
1:01:35
possibly be why not adopt the mindset that makes me as competent and as fearsome as possible if you have to install software in your own mind why
1:01:41
would I not install software that makes me capable of not only driving a Bugatti and flying on private jets but sitting
1:01:47
in a Romanian dungeon covered in cockroaches I need to be able to do all of it so why would I believe in something that made me incapable I don't
1:01:54
believe in depression because I think that even the belief in another itself when you feel depressed you'll start to
1:02:00
consider maybe I have depression then you'll go see a psychiatrist who tells you you have depression and they want you on pills it's the belief that goes
1:02:07
down the spiral if I feel sad I go I'm depressed today I'll be fine tomorrow so why I suspect you're right or you're
1:02:13
what you're saying is pointing toward truth that's my personal view but even if I disagree to you I wouldn't I don't
1:02:20
okay I disagree with you why is that so offensive what you just said well that's what's interesting because when I said depression wasn't real
1:02:27
the number of people who would attack me defending depression this is why I didn't understand right you say
1:02:33
depression isn't real but depression has ruined my life and this is super real and it ruined my life and I lost my marriage I'm like if I told you it
1:02:39
wasn't real you should be coming to me saying tell me how it's not real please help me with my depression why are you trying to
1:02:45
convince me that it's real why are you sticking up for it why are you defending depression and why would I adopt the
1:02:52
thinking of someone who's sad why would I you're going to convince me to take your worldview you just told me your
1:02:58
wife left you you're fat and you want to kill yourself and you want me to sit here and go with
1:03:05
my perfect life and go you know what I want to think like this guy you're at your mind I don't believe in
1:03:11
it and because I don't believe in it it's made me the kind of person who can't become depressed and the reason
1:03:16
they don't like me attacking that is because depression is a fantastic way to subdue a population right if everybody's depressed it's hard
1:03:23
to have a revolution you're depressed oh they've locked us all in our houses I don't want to go outside anyway I'm sad
1:03:30
right so depression is a fantastic tool of population control they won't they have no problem with you
1:03:36
being depressed they have a problem with you being the opposite principled and energetic no you don't want principled
1:03:41
energetic people that's a problem a bunch of depressed people easy if you had to invade a country
1:03:47
would you rather the opposing Army be principled and energetic or depressed I'll tell you I would not want to be
1:03:53
invaded by a cheerful Army absolutely scary they're having too much fun right you want them all to be depressed
1:03:59
so a morose Army is easier to defeat I agree absolutely so depression is a
1:04:04
defended idea you're not allowed to even talk about it you're not allowed to help people get out of it right they like the idea of a depressed population and this
1:04:10
is what I say to people now I'm not stupid I understand like PTSD is real I understand mental health is real I'm not
1:04:16
saying that but I say if you're an 18 year old boy or 18 year old man and your life is pretty much okay bacteria didn't
1:04:22
steal your eyesight which could have happened you never had a car crash and lost both of your legs which could have happened you're actually very fortunate
1:04:28
and you wake up and you say I'm depressed I think you're an idiot I don't think you're depressed I think you've been psyopped I think you feel a
1:04:35
little bit of depression and you can fix that by changing your life I think if you became rich and strong and smart and
1:04:41
successful and you worked hard and you dedicated yourself and you were motivated and you tried your very very best to become excellent you probably
1:04:48
wouldn't feel depressed anymore which means it's not a disease is it so how so why would you the only reason
1:04:53
you're even saying you have depression is because you believe in it so you're arguing for cause and effect you're saying if you live a certain way you're
1:04:59
going to feel a certain way absolutely and I also would argue that I think we've evolutionarily even though I do believe in God I think
1:05:06
that we've designed ourselves and the human has grown into a way where if you feel depressed or sad I think that's a
1:05:11
fantastic Trigger or a warning signal to do something if you were to say to me Andrew you have to do you have to
1:05:16
complete this Monumental task you have to conquer the world
1:05:22
I would say okay but I need a I need a emotional motivation to do that I need to be unhappy having not completed the
1:05:29
task you know I need to be uncomfortable right if you're uncomfortable being out
1:05:34
of shape you'll get in shape if you're happy being out of shape then you're just going to stay out of shape right so if you feel a degree of
1:05:40
uncomfortableness inside of your mind I think it's just your mind telling you that something about your life needs to change yes you need to get up and change
1:05:45
something guys would say to me I'm depressed because I'm fat and I have no girlfriend
1:05:51
and I'd say no you have no girlfriend and you're fat and that's why you're depressed if you go change those two
1:05:58
things you'd probably be surprised that your disease goes away I had another guy say he's gonna kill himself I said listen
1:06:04
it's back when I used to reply to my emails when I was smaller I said make me a promise get a six-pack first of beer
1:06:11
I said yeah six-pack first get in fantastic shape and then do whatever you want didn't want to kill himself one season
1:06:17
fantastic so he did it yeah after before and after I put him on Twitter kind of interesting that isn't it so how are we
1:06:23
going to say we have this disease which is cause and effect how are we gonna have we say we have this disease where there's something
1:06:28
wrong with you as a man you have a disease because your life sucks I mean I don't think that's true I think
1:06:35
that your life just sucks and you should change it and another thing I also preach and this is another thing that's very important I also think as a man
1:06:41
because life is a man is pain and suffering and when I say that because you're never going to be a good man or
1:06:46
good at being a man without pain and suffering you're going to have to go through a bunch of CR of and have a terrible life to become a good man I
1:06:53
think you should embrace that and accept it and I think that the the correct mental model for men to have is a degree
1:06:59
of stoicism and not to be too concerned with even how they feel if I woke up today happy if I woke up
1:07:05
today and happy I would have done this interview with you if I woke up today sad I would have done this interview
1:07:10
with you what's the difference why put so much importance on my emotion if certain things must be done I must work I must
1:07:17
train I must see Tucker Carlson I must resist the Matrix I've got things to do so why are we going to sit around and
1:07:23
talk about how I feel if it doesn't even affect how I act and as a man it shouldn't because there's too much to do and the the
1:07:30
masculine world is hyper competitive this is another thing most people don't understand really agree it's hyper competitive out here all the women want
1:07:37
few men at the top the Ferrari you you don't want a Ferrari to dry fast you want Ferrari because other men want Ferrari and can't have one it's hyper
1:07:43
competitive so if you're competing against every other man for every dollar you make every girl you see the house you live in the car you drive the life
1:07:50
you live you're not going to be able to compete with the person who performs regardless
1:07:55
of how they feel if you only compete when you feel like competing right because there's men like me out
1:08:00
there who will be sad every day and out compete you regardless I don't care how I feel I will still win
1:08:06
and that's the kind of mindset you need to adopt so I don't want no man come to the job to do stop whining go to work completely
1:08:12
I agree completely so when men say oh I don't I feel sad who cares the world
1:08:18
doesn't care all the men who are out here to destroy you and take your girl don't care so why are you why do you
1:08:23
care like the only the person who should care at least is you you're the only person who wakes up every day who should
1:08:29
have a genuine vested interest in improving your life nobody else wakes up and wants to improve your life only you so if nobody else cares about how you
1:08:35
feel why do you care so I my argument also for depression is you're depressed fine have you trained
1:08:43
today well that doesn't change what you should do with your life depressed or not and I
1:08:48
don't say this because I'm an eternally happy person I say this because I've experienced all ranges of human emotion
1:08:53
I was in a Romanian jail cell with cockroaches crawling all over me as I slept I never missed a day of training I
1:08:59
wouldn't say I was particularly happy but push-ups must be done so they got did you you're very close to your
1:09:06
brother correct and you were locked away for part of that with him and this did you have fun at all with him
1:09:12
yes I I do think there's something inside of men whereas if you're with your boys or
1:09:18
you're with your group of men yes there's something inside of us totally and it allows you to make the absolute best of the worst situations maybe
1:09:25
that's a Evolution from war you know all the men went to war and you saw all this pain and suffering and you saw heads
1:09:31
people decapitated and you're injured but then you sit around the campfire and you're laughing you're laughing that's
1:09:36
right it's something inside of us it's like a coping mechanism when you're around men so when me and him were together no matter how bad the scenario
1:09:42
or no matter what they tried to do to us part of us would just look at each other like cigarette
1:09:47
and you find joy in that and yeah there's definitely and that's another thing I think a lot of men are lacking a
1:09:52
lot of men are missing is a masculine support network I think buddies buddies yeah you know you you talk to a guy and
1:09:59
say what was the highlight of your life what was the best time of your life and they'll say oh college football it's not about the football it's about the team yeah you know and I
1:10:06
think a lot of that's destroyed as well because also when you it's interesting how everything interconnects when you
1:10:12
destroy honor and principle and the masculine Essence inside of men well now
1:10:17
as a man it's very hard to have friends I wouldn't want to have a male friend who had no principles no honors and and
1:10:22
didn't work hard and was always crying about being sad we don't want to hang around with him for he's a loser right
1:10:28
so then your support Network's destroyed and I think that men have always needed that since the dawn of time and I think
1:10:34
that's gone but they don't have friends men especially middle-aged men have no friends absolutely because they've been
1:10:39
told that to give them all away and do as the wife says and then she left him no wonder he wants to kill himself
1:10:45
wouldn't you no wonder he's depressed it sounds like the worst existence ever and now we're living in a world now especially where everything is hyper
1:10:52
competitive especially the sexual Marketplace like if you're a 52 year old overweight average income no
1:10:59
Fame dude and you have to find a girl it's gonna be pretty difficult to find a
1:11:05
good one this could be very hard so it was like of course he's lonely and then his kids don't respect him
1:11:11
they're busy like of course he's sad like it's actually heartbreaking to discuss it is heartbreaking it's heartbreaking but then how do you
1:11:17
prevent that happening well then you need to be a man of honor and principle and make sure that you keep your support networks and make sure that your woman
1:11:23
does respect you and a woman's gonna respect you when she says sees other men respect you yes and and they're only going to respect you if you respect
1:11:28
yourself but to respect yourself you have to be the kind of person who says no what do you think of porn
1:11:35
there's been some statistics there's been some studies done most men or less men are having sex than ever before I've
1:11:41
seen that yeah and that's that well that's an extension of the fact that masculine virtue is being destroyed that's something that's interesting
1:11:46
about all these things they Psy off especially men they say listen women want a feminist man women want a man
1:11:54
with no moral principle who would make sure that there's a conversation about who should fight the burglar when your
1:12:00
house is broken into because equal opportunities equal rights of course don't you know don't presume just
1:12:06
because you're a man that you should defend her physically of course not that makes you a bigot and a misogynist so they convinced men to adopt these
1:12:14
virtues in ways and of course women by and large dislike them for it so now as men's as masculinity he's
1:12:21
plummeted a whole bunch of men are simply not having sex anymore and then they become addicted to porn which is cucking effectively two people having
1:12:28
sex and you're just watching it and it's and it's become a yeah good point I mean and it's become a pandemic
1:12:35
right so men are replacing genuine sexual relationships with just
1:12:40
the computer screen and porn and it's becoming a very very big problem and that's also exasperated by the fact that
1:12:46
I think the sexual Marketplace has become globalized this is the thing I say to young men a lot of men come to me
1:12:51
with problems and my only answer to them is masculine Excellence I say that in
1:12:56
the world we live in today being a normal man or below normal is going to be terrible
1:13:02
you have to be an exceptional man because the sexual Marketplace especially even you just want to find a wife is globalized if you in 1955 if you
1:13:12
met the hot girl in the Nebraskan town she was the hot girl in the Nebraska town if you meet her today she's being
1:13:18
offered to go to court Cheval and go skiing in France and she's being offered to fly to Dubai and there's millionaires
1:13:25
who can just fly her anywhere and give her anything she wants and who are you right it's getting
1:13:31
harder and harder as a man to even find the most basic human function of
1:13:37
reproduction even to just find a woman you can reproduce with it's becoming more and more difficult
1:13:43
you also couple that with the fact that they've destroyed Morality In women also so when you destroy the Morality In men
1:13:49
and you destroy how a man should act and then you destroy how a woman should act it's their go you're both going in the opposite direction
1:13:55
most women out there are very happy to share a man who's just rich and famous and they don't they don't care so so
1:14:01
you're the normal guy you know there's this Rich famous guy with 30 girls that's 29 dudes who are lonely and they
1:14:08
end up watching porn and if you have a porn addiction or you have a problem with porn you have a problem with yourself because I guarantee if you're
1:14:14
the kind of man you're supposed to be you would have no time for that and you wouldn't need it I can confirm that's absolutely not only
1:14:21
the case yeah yeah so the fact you even need porn shows there's a problem with you as a man because if you were the
1:14:27
kind of man you could be and I genuinely believe that any man can become anything then you'd have unlimited sexual options
1:14:33
and you would have no interest in that and and I do want to make this clear to the world because there's a bit of a misconception about my story my father
1:14:39
was in the military and then he left to become a professional chess player he was a traveling chess player you don't
1:14:44
make money with that my mother and father broke up at age nine we moved to England purely because
1:14:49
you get more help from the state I was raised on welfare in Marsh Farm which is the worst area of the worst Town
1:14:55
loosened with the highest crime rate I went to a school with a four percent pass rate single mother household effectively
1:15:01
starting from absolutely nothing became a kickboxing world champion your mother was English English correct
1:15:08
so I I started at the absolute lowest Echelon of life and I would like to consider myself pretty somewhere near the top now I've been through absolutely
1:15:14
every stage so when I say to men you can become anything you want and my answer to you is masculine Excellence there's
1:15:20
no other answer I can't tell you how to rig the game and cheat the game if we're all racing a race and I have a Ferrari
1:15:26
and you have a Nissan I mean sure you can get a bit better at driving but you're probably going to lose you have to get a better character
1:15:32
to play this game of life so that's why I preached masculine Excellence because for many of the world's problems today porn sexual
1:15:40
access being respected by your peers making sure that your wife's going to stay with you after the children are
1:15:46
born for a very long time right being happy anything it all comes down to who
1:15:51
you are as a man a lot of the answer the only answer is masculine Excellence there's nothing you can do besides hard
1:15:56
work accept the trauma and pain and suffering and and work harder than everyone else around you worked and and
1:16:03
that's why porn is a problem so I will genuinely say to any man out there who finds himself loading up that website go take a look in the mirror and realize
1:16:09
why no one wants to you if you're fair and and I said this to guys before if you were a girl
1:16:16
with all the choices she has would you choose you think about it and if you're honest with
1:16:22
yourself a lot of these guys if they look in the mirror and go you know what no I wouldn't choose me work out why and
1:16:28
do something about it absolutely not yourself accountability this is something that's also missing I take accountability for everything in my life
1:16:35
even going to jail although it was unfair although it's a matrix attack although it's garbage it was my fault I
1:16:41
sat there and go what did I do wrong how can I learn from this where did where is my part to play in this what did I do
1:16:48
because my actions or what I have the most control over I have self-accountability for everything if a woman doesn't want to
1:16:54
sleep with me I don't sit and say ah women are this way Society is that way I just didn't say okay why what can I
1:17:01
change so any man who's loading up porn needs to go have a long conversation in the mirror and realize that he's not
1:17:07
desirable or as desirable as he should be or could be I come from absolutely nothing I'm mixed race my father was
1:17:12
black and my mother's white so statistically mixed race single household single mother household bad
1:17:18
area I I ticked every box to end up in jail I ended up in jail for the wrong reasons
1:17:25
you fulfilled your destiny yeah Escape statistics I kicked every box
1:17:30
to be a delinquent and I refuse to be one I absolutely refuse to be a delinquent I said no
1:17:36
that's not who I want to be I want to be a superhero and I know the only way to be a superhero is to one suffer like
1:17:43
Batman did his parents died and two work hard what does your mother think my mother is exceptionally proud
1:17:48
of me she she still worries because mothers worry but even when we were in jail she said
1:17:54
well I know you're both strong so like she knows she has men she knows she has
1:17:59
you know that's pretty great yeah of course and and I think that's what
1:18:05
I mean I I I believe especially also I think a man has a duty to his last name
1:18:11
I think we carry the last name we would do eat to our last name I am a tate I am my Father's son the reason my father so
1:18:18
is discussed so heavily is because of my Monumental success I keep him alive via my success I would love to think my son
1:18:24
does the same thing they will talk about my son in a way where they're so interested in his life path that I must be discussed by extension and then I
1:18:30
live forever so I have a duty to Tate I have a duty to my last name I must perform and this is what I said to my
1:18:36
mother on the phone I'm gonna tell you it's fine oh but the conditions are bad yeah that's life and even as a man today
1:18:43
you're waking up you want to load up a porn website you should you should have respect for your last name and you should sit and say is this who I am this
1:18:49
is what I do a lot of this comes down to the things we discussed at the very beginning self-respect so honor dignity well you
1:18:58
have no dignity I have too much dignity for that and a lot of these men have no dignity no self-respect and it's all an
1:19:04
extension extends of why they're never going to be who they could be and also what they do to cope with that and yeah porn is a coping mechanism
1:19:11
what do you think of women I think women are some of the most powerful people on the planet firstly a
1:19:16
lot of the conversations we're having most people don't understand that women are The Gatekeepers and women are the
1:19:21
ultimate judges women are the ultimate judges especially of sexual access right so when I say
1:19:27
that maybe 40 of the letters I got in jail were from women just love letters
1:19:33
perfume on them and kiss kiss marks and the traditional masculine role is still
1:19:39
respected and loved by so many women if you were to ask the average woman on the street who hasn't lost her mind what she
1:19:44
wants in a man she would like to be financially provided for physically protected I love women I think they are
1:19:50
the most powerful and precious things on the planet they give life but I believe that when you love a woman
1:19:56
you should want to protect her and provide for her and take care of her I don't believe you love a woman by
1:20:01
wanting to do everything she says and cucking to her I don't believe that because I love women I should have no
1:20:07
standards and what I expect in a woman I don't think because I don't think loving women is sitting there going a woman can
1:20:12
do whatever she wants to me and I put up with it I don't think that's loving women at all I think loving women is saying I'm going to be the best man I
1:20:17
can be and the only way I'm going to be a good man is with the degree of standard and I'm going to be the best man I can be
1:20:23
for you and when I say these things I get attacked for being a misogynist because well how is that I think massages means
1:20:30
someone who hates women correct because I have conversations with women who are less I've done some podcasts with women who are very promiscuous
1:20:37
and I've explained to them that since the dawn of human time in every single Society across the planet promiscuity
1:20:43
and females has been frowned upon yes that's true it hasn't been frowned upon in men but it has been in women
1:20:48
I explained in a big way in a big way in many in many parts of the world to this day you can't get married if you're not
1:20:54
virgin I'm not saying all women should be virgins I was explaining to her that female promiscu he has always been hated
1:20:59
and every holy book it's disliked you've bought into this new thing the
1:21:05
last 10 years and you seem to think it's empowering and I would argue that it's not empowering and I sat there and had a
1:21:11
conversation with this promiscuous woman and I said to her that she is doing herself a disservice and she's dishonoring herself and she's never
1:21:17
going to be happy or fulfilled jumping from bed to bed and I was told that this makes me
1:21:24
misogynistic because women are empowered and they can make whatever choices they want and I'm insecure to believe that a
1:21:29
woman who slept with 300 men is somehow changed mentally and her ability to bond
1:21:35
and love a man has been affected by that but it is that's true well unfortunately you're gonna end up in Armenian jail
1:21:41
cell phone massages no I mean I love women um and so I and I've seen it and that is
1:21:46
true what you said the thing that's the thing that's interesting is that women intrinsically understand this yeah because if you see a woman
1:21:53
dislike another woman what's the first name she calls her slot the first thing the first thing a girl
1:21:59
says to a girl she doesn't like is the biggest insult insult that comes to her mind is that she's promiscuous right so
1:22:06
it's interesting but I've been a call to misogynist for that and then I've made I've been on the
1:22:11
internet for a long time I've made some jokes I've made some videos and people don't
1:22:17
understand satire or comedy there's one that they keep repeating I made a joke
1:22:22
next to my bed I had a Glock like many people do and then I had a knife next to my bed and there was a comedic skit
1:22:29
where it said the girl caught me cheating and she picked up the knife and I slapped out of her hands say you
1:22:35
still love me and they they cut the bit out where I talked about the girl attacking me with the knife that just
1:22:41
took the bit where I say slap the knife out of her hand you're the boss and they take the massage and it's just taken out
1:22:47
of context and that's another thing that's happened to me and I am aware of this and like I said I take absolute self-accountability
1:22:52
but the way you make jokes and make videos when you get 100 views is very different than the way you would make a
1:22:58
joke or make a video when you get millions of views and when they're trying their best to find that look at a four hour video and
1:23:05
find three seconds I'll give an example of it where it hurt me very recently I did a podcast where I was discussing
1:23:12
corruption I discussed why which country I believe is the most corrupt country in the world
1:23:18
they start a lot of wars and uh the answer to that by the person
1:23:23
I was discussing it with is well you live in Romania Romania is corrupt I said Romania is corrupt correct but I don't think they there's certainly
1:23:31
corruption but they they don't start Monumental Wars which end up in millions of deaths I would argue that they're
1:23:36
corruption because the police man stops me and I can bribe my way out of a parking ticket or a speeding ticket is
1:23:41
far less destructive so we discussed this at length for hours they cut out the bit where I said
1:23:48
Romania is corrupt I showed it to the judge that kept me in jail yeah so and that's that's my problem in
1:23:56
a nutshell long format content people will find a little bit edited up and try and attack me with it and that's where this whole misogynistic things come from
1:24:03
it's either from me arguing with promiscuous women on podcasts designed for promiscuous women to argue their
1:24:09
point and I destroy them so flawlessly I'm a bad person or something taken out of context and
1:24:17
it's insane because like I said the amount the amount of support I get from women is actually monumental the amount
1:24:23
of mothers who write to me and say that their son's doing better than ever the amount of women who write to me and say their boyfriend is doing better than
1:24:29
ever the amount of women who love me and just want to meet me this idea that I'm hated by women is probably the biggest
1:24:36
lie about this whole story I don't want to brag but I can assure the world that's absolutely not true
1:24:42
I had thousands of letters of support from women in fact there was one girl never met her
1:24:48
she would play love songs from her car outside the jail so she put the music on and play love
1:24:54
songs and uh I managed to tweet out via my cousin the songs I wanted to listen to
1:25:00
Whitesnake is This Love and she was me and she played them for me never met her
1:25:06
don't know who she is so you're in a Romanian prison cell requesting white snake on the radio in the car outside
1:25:12
correct and some girl would pull up and and put kind of a surreal moment put her speakers on full and play me my love
1:25:18
songs for a good like three or four minutes for the police would come make her move I got a song a day but yeah this idea that I'm universally
1:25:25
hated by women is insanity that's not that's not true so you said you're a mixed race your dad was black her mom
1:25:31
was not was white English what do you make of the race conversation in the
1:25:36
United States I think it's deliberately they're trying to put fuel in the fire and they're
1:25:42
deliberately trying to accelerate division this is what I believe I think that
1:25:47
if a black billionaire and a white billionaire meet somewhere
1:25:53
I don't think there's much conversation about race I think no I don't think there's any racism no
1:26:00
interesting they're not that interested in the topic actually they don't care right right but amongst the lower
1:26:05
echelons of the populists they seem very interested in trying to turn us all on each other yes I wonder why that is and
1:26:11
I wonder why they deliberately make laws and push Media Matters which are designed to do exactly that I wonder why
1:26:18
that is we can sit and I have my own theories but um I think what certain people in the world
1:26:24
would be most afraid of is the white people of a certain economic class and the black people of a certain economic
1:26:31
class shaking hands and saying this is I think that would be very yes intimidating for them
1:26:38
so it's certainly accelerated and it's also very interesting because as a mixed race person I will also sit and State
1:26:45
I don't look particularly black most people can't guess where I'm from I've had more discrimination against me for
1:26:51
being a straight male that I've ever had for my skin color I've had more people look at me or have problems with me
1:26:57
purely because of my sexual orientation and my general generally masculine Essence that I've ever had anybody say
1:27:03
anything about my skin color ever and I'll also say if somebody has a real problem with my skin color who cares if someone's that ignorant
1:27:11
who gives a like it's also I I do find it amazing they managed to psyop
1:27:16
people into being so brutally offended by it if someone to come up to me and say you're not white and say correct
1:27:23
have a nice day who cares like I I it's amazing how they they've got everyone
1:27:29
wrapped up in this but yeah it certainly accelerated another thing that's very interesting about it
1:27:34
especially in America a lot of Americans are insulated to
1:27:39
I feel like world history yeah I've noticed you know they're like oh slavery slavery slavery slavery was everywhere
1:27:47
every country had slaves Arabs had slaves Chinese had slaves Aztecs had
1:27:53
slaves everybody had slaves the American Indians had slaves everybody did honestly correct and they're like oh we've been enslaved everyone was
1:27:59
enslaved unfortunately the world wasn't such a nice place right and there's been
1:28:04
ethnic divisions in every single country on Earth since the dawn of time there still is in many countries in the
1:28:10
world today they believe this is a uniquely American issue and I would strongly argue that one is
1:28:17
completely not only not and two I think that if you are black white asian I think if you stand up
1:28:25
self-respect work hard try your best turn up on time firm handshake don't
1:28:30
make excuses for anything don't look for an easy way out no matter what your skin color is in America or England or any
1:28:37
other Western Nation I think you can be extremely successful I don't think anything's stopping you that's not the message you get from say
1:28:43
Carmel Harris who's also mixed race her dad was Jamaican her mama's Indian but
1:28:49
race is really at the center of her identity and her politics what do you make of say Kamal Harris well let's let's look at why they purport the idea
1:28:56
that depression is so powerful and that you can just catch it from the sky and now you're permanently depressed no matter what happens to you and there's
1:29:02
nothing you can do about it and you can't improve your life and you can't be a better person right it's that self-limiting belief I think by also
1:29:09
pushing this racism argument it's also very much the same thing I think if you adopt that mindset if you wake up and you're a particular color you're purple
1:29:15
and you believe purple people can't make it what's your chance of making it zero yeah right so that's what's so
1:29:22
destructive about it this is why I'll even argue when I argue this point with people and they try and say oh but this
1:29:27
happens and they pull out these statistics and all this garbage from The Matrix I say listen even if even if the world's racist against
1:29:34
Purple People the best thing you can do is be such an exceptional purple person that they need you and they need you the
1:29:42
only answer is hard work the only answer is self-accountability masculine Essence honor dignity making your ancestors
1:29:49
proud of you because you hold the same last name and send the answers the same regardless anyway but when people at
1:29:55
Kamala or Kamala are pushing this racism agenda they're trying to say to people
1:30:00
effectively you'll never be anything and you don't stand a chance of ever being anything and I think that that makes people who
1:30:06
aren't anything feel a little bit better about themselves it's cope and that's the only fans she has left
1:30:12
are losers who she's told it's okay to be a loser because there's no way you could have not been a loser and I will
1:30:18
argue you could have been something a lot more than that and you shouldn't listen to anybody who tells you're not going to be a loser somewhere to come to me and say Andrew your mixed race you're
1:30:24
from a single mother household you're never going to be rich I'll say watch me I don't believe you I don't believe you who are you
1:30:31
so everything she's saying is one wrong two it's destructive to believe in three I
1:30:37
think it's her last hope at having any kind of fan at all because she's largely incompetent I don't think I've ever heard her put a
1:30:43
compenduous coherent sentence together um and perhaps also maybe that's the reason
1:30:51
why she leans so heavily on Race because she's not impressive or competent so she
1:30:57
can say oh but I'm discolor and I did it instead of actually talking about how good of a job she's doing because if you
1:31:02
have to discuss that part of her career or that part of her current life path I think she'd be in a lot of
1:31:09
trouble I'm going to show you video of Joe Biden's Challenger for the Democratic primary Robert F Kennedy Jr
1:31:33
let's go let's go let's go
1:31:41
what do you think of him I think a strong body is a strong mind I don't think there's anything wrong with the
1:31:46
man exercising all until up until the age she dies why wouldn't he I think that the bottom line of masculinity
1:31:51
since the dawn of human time has been a propensity and a capability for violence I think that's what makes a man a man I
1:31:57
don't see any possible negative connotation with being in good physical shape I think that's a fantastic way to
1:32:02
show discipline which is very important and indeed by a man who's important especially a world leader in fact I love
1:32:07
the idea of an elected world leader being in fantastic physical shape I think it shows that there are motivated
1:32:14
disciplined person and I have a lot of respect for him for that and I think that in in the military we make it
1:32:19
mandatory right to be in fantastic physical condition yes to to so why wouldn't we have it mandatory for people
1:32:25
who are in charge of the entire world I think it's fantastic the president United States seems to be failing physically as you look back
1:32:33
at the country whose passport you hold at the president what what's your reaction
1:32:39
well sometimes and it's not very often I consider myself ignorant
1:32:46
but I feel like there must be some magic I missed because it wasn't even the most voted for president in history oh yeah
1:32:53
billions of votes yeah it must there must be some magic I just can't detect Tucker I don't want to more than Barack
1:32:59
Obama 81 million votes it's insane and I mean Barack yeah sure he was very
1:33:05
intelligent articulate yep he was concise and compenduous with his ideas he could make you understand how he
1:33:11
thinks yes but Joe must be better in some way I
1:33:16
just I can't seem to seem see how and I guess the fault is with me I
1:33:22
don't know what to say about that one it's one of those lies that's so ridiculous that you're just like
1:33:29
I don't okay you got more votes than Barack Obama shut up he did
1:33:40
excuse me um I want to get your take this is sort of small ball but it it I think tells
1:33:46
you something about a larger Trend in the United States this is a state senator from the state of Wisconsin in a
1:33:52
public hearing recently saying in a discussion on a crime Bill the
1:33:57
suburbs here she is the suburbs because they don't know a goddamn thing
1:34:06
about how life is in the city
1:34:13
what is that there's a hostility there where does that come from that comes from being a Perpetual victim that comes
1:34:18
from being told that everything that's happening to her is not her fault and she has no self-accountability even though she's managed to become a senator
1:34:24
somehow she's still oppressed and that means that everyone else who looks like her is also completely and
1:34:29
utterly oppressed and anybody who has a slightly better life in any ways by extension a bad person because they
1:34:35
weren't oppressed yes and that's where the hate comes from the division is put there by these mindsets which are being purported by the people in charge of the
1:34:41
world convincing you that you have no control all over your own life and that's why she's so resentful towards
1:34:46
people who have done well in life not even as well as her I would also argue perhaps I'm incorrect
1:34:52
that she probably lives in a suburb of course she does so she's a hypocrite on top of that yeah
1:34:58
but Hypocrites are the Fantastic thing about being a hypocrite is if you're a hypocrite with a little bit of power influence you're allowed to be a
1:35:04
hypocrite because you're you're spreading information on the larger problem in fact this is actually interesting one
1:35:10
of my funnest things I might I'm going to announce this here on your show for everyone to know this is World exclusive
1:35:15
I want to become a climate change activist because when I was younger people would say what do you want to be when you grow
1:35:21
up do you want to be a fireman you want to be Batman Etc and I wasn't sure what would really make me happy but now I'm ultra wealthy and I fly around on
1:35:27
private jets all the time I think that now is the time for me to become one of those hypocritical climate change 100
1:35:32
it's going to be super fun it was your carbon footprint grows you're concerned about carbon Footprints grows absolutely
1:35:39
eat the bugs sell your car how dare you eat me
1:35:45
on my jet of course I have meat but I'm allowed to be a hypocrite because I'm spreading awareness for the overall purpose for the greater good for the
1:35:51
greater good I have to get to the climate change activist meetings so uh which happened to me in
1:35:57
Switzerland I noticed of course so although I'm flying well before this arrest they're never in New Jersey Never
1:36:02
So before this arrest I was on about three or four Jets a week but um every single time I was flying on
1:36:08
my private plane I was extremely concerned about the carbon footprint of course you were of course and so I am now a climate change activist I just
1:36:13
want to let the whole world know because once you get to a certain level of power of influence you're absolutely not really allowed to be a complete hypocrite so you're allowed to live in
1:36:19
the suburb and then tell everyone the suburbs and uh pretend that you're oppressed
1:36:25
when you're a senator of the most powerful Nation on the planet because it's just it's a logic fail on every
1:36:31
planet on every level so one of the human activities has got to produce the greatest carbon footprint I would think
1:36:36
War right diesel-powered machines Munitions going
1:36:42
off so I was a little bit surprised to see Greta thunberg with zelenski this
1:36:48
morning it's what's interesting to me is this firstly I would never kill myself secondly
1:36:54
imagine these people are so detached from reality imagine going you know what we need to
1:37:02
do brain wave we need to drum up support for this garbage let's take our let's take the
1:37:08
the most loved woman Greta and the most loved man zielinski let's
1:37:13
make a me think about the pr let's bring a camera and imagine people sitting around a table going that's a great
1:37:19
that's that's going to really make people support this gives a I don't want to swear I'm
1:37:26
sorry but some young girl turns up to a war zone who has nothing why is she
1:37:32
there what are they going to talk about what's their conversation I think she only yells I don't think she does talk I
1:37:38
don't understand is she gonna talk about how the childhood has been stolen from all those million Ukrainian men who've
1:37:44
been born blown to pieces like she talks about childhood being stolen because we drive you know cars I don't think she is
1:37:50
I don't think she's going to mention that is it just a big PR opportunity like what PR team came up with this concoction and thought this will this
1:37:56
will keep him on side it's mind-bending to me who even thought this was a good idea it's crazy but of
1:38:03
course somebody did somebody thought it was a fantastic idea
1:38:08
have you ever met Greta thinberg no but me and her have had some our internet arguments hey I think it went to prison
1:38:14
for it right yeah correct which is amazing because I'm a climate change activist so I'm on her team
1:38:20
you know I was in Sweden during covid so we could have met she didn't want to hang out with me unfortunately and then
1:38:26
now I'm flying around on my jet everywhere spreading news about climate change same thing like in my Bugatti
1:38:32
obviously it's got a big engine I make sure to talk about climate change out the windows as I drive but I'm on her side she doesn't seem to
1:38:38
be very interested you pass about climate change yeah don't eat me eat the bugs what's wrong with you people you don't care about the Earth
1:38:44
like if if you don't if you don't start caring about climate change all those politicians with beachfront property are
1:38:51
going to lose their houses yes and they're very concerned about climate change which is why they bought their houses on the beachfront so they can be
1:38:56
the first to let you know it's coming the early warning system right they're
1:39:02
very concerned that's why they want to be right there on the beach quite honorable if you think about it kind of kind of on the front lines the
1:39:08
climate crisis absolutely lead from the front so good um
1:39:14
but one more point about this sorry to go on and on oh I love it but when I say
1:39:19
these things people you don't care about the environment and I try and explain to them I love nature you love Hunting
1:39:25
Fishing I love nature passionately the problem with all of these things is not that I don't like nature the problem is
1:39:31
that nearly any issue which appears to be virtuous on the planet today is Trojan Horse with garbage that's the
1:39:38
problem I have no problem with fixing or loot maintaining or preserving nature I
1:39:43
have a problem with them telling me I have to maintain nature them Trojan horsing my bankruptcy into the middle of
1:39:50
it knowing that nature won't be fixed then telling me it's about nature and
1:39:55
telling me I should agree with it that's my problem there's no there's nothing left on the planet
1:40:00
no issue which isn't Trojan Horse with absolute garbage yeah yeah and if you're gonna sit there and tell me that I need
1:40:07
to give more money to the government to stop the Sun from being hot
1:40:13
I'm going to argue with you that I'd rather keep my money thank you very much yes so this is the problem with all
1:40:19
these issues it's nearly anything when I argue against some people you don't care about the issue I do but you're not smart enough to understand that the
1:40:25
legislation around this issue is so large hasn't even been read by most people voting for it yeah and there's
1:40:31
something in the middle of it which is going to damage every single person's life which has nothing at all to do with
1:40:36
the issue itself and most people don't understand that they co-ops people's best instincts their love of nature which is a virtue
1:40:42
of course their love of their neighbors during covid don't you care about your neighbors oh completely yes you do in your grandparents I review my
1:40:48
grandparents of course of course and you're a bad and you're a bad person if you resist I was a terrible person for going to Sweden you're a very bad person
1:40:55
you don't care about anyone else that and that's how they do it's weaponized virtue and the the my opposers
1:41:02
every single virtuous thing that comes out of their mouth is never from a place of virtue it's from a place of hate yes it's weaponized and also and I don't
1:41:09
talk about this very often but people can go right now to tatepledge.com I donate 25 million dollars a year to
1:41:16
feeding children in war-torn countries especially in the Islamic world because that's where all the war is
1:41:21
nobody ever mentions that ever nobody mentions any of the charitable work I do nobody mentions any of the lives I saved
1:41:27
nobody mentions any of the people who support me they don't mention anything at all they just come along so you're a bad person and I say if I'm a bad person
1:41:33
let's talk about the things you've done to genuinely benefit Humanity besides sit on Twitter and talk have you
1:41:38
ever done anything for anybody ever are you capable of doing anything because the things
1:41:44
that make me a bad person right you don't like me for my principles and the fact I stand up for myself and the fact
1:41:50
I have parameters and I say no everything you hate about me those are the things that allow me to even do good in the world
1:41:55
if I was like you mush goo I couldn't even help anyone if you had to help someone today how could you even do it
1:42:02
you're broke and you're lazy and you're stupid you can't even you can't even Enlighten anybody you can just spread hate
1:42:09
how is that helping the world these people are a net negative genuinely
1:42:15
and that's what's so crazy about being attacked for your morality like I'm being now and when you're a good person
1:42:20
in general they attack your morality because the people who are attacking you are absolutely immoral the ultimate hypocritical hypocriticism
1:42:27
ultimate even more than my private jet climate change
1:42:32
stance so it's it's certainly unique I do like to believe though we're entering a new
1:42:38
stage of Consciousness I do like to believe at least from 10 to 15 years ago more people are I think covert woke some
1:42:44
people up I do like to believe the MSM credibility is tanking in real time Trump helped massively fake news
1:42:52
two words before Trump when did you ever hear fake news I didn't really hear it that often yeah
1:42:58
fake news fake news fake news and he did a fantastic job of that and he's starting to wake people up so I'd
1:43:04
like to believe there's a degree of us winning but I just want to make it very clear to the people who attack me and the people who
1:43:09
attack anybody who stands up for what they believe in a lot of their virtue their virtue their virtue signaling is
1:43:15
just hate peddling and when they can't call you unsuccessful and they can't call you stupid they have to find a way to hurt
1:43:22
you and the only way they can do that is to say you're a bad person I've noticed yes yes I have
1:43:28
um so here's Joe Biden expressing his concern about how Putin
1:43:34
is doing in the war in Iraq interesting it's hard to tell but as you're clearly losing the war in Iraq he's losing the
1:43:41
war at home and he is uh become a physical flyer around the world do you
1:43:46
think Putin is losing the war in Iraq I don't think he's losing the war in Iraq I don't think he's fighting a war in Iraq okay
1:43:51
um he also says losing the war at home I don't think he's fighting in Russia and I'm also not sure he's losing so it's
1:43:57
pretty interesting statement on many levels it's scary you know it's a joke but it's scary
1:44:04
because I would never kill myself but I think the reason he was put into
1:44:10
office is because he's incompetent yes because that makes him easy to control influence that's what's most scary
1:44:16
it's not scary that he's becoming competent in office is that they looked at him and goes that's who we need that guy
1:44:21
that's what's most scary to me does it surprise you that the weakest president is also the most destructive
1:44:27
weak men are always destructive because hurt people hurt people yeah I know I heard someone said that to me a
1:44:34
long time ago hurt people hurt people they were talking about a relationship and I said that's true if your heart's been broken you're probably going to be
1:44:40
a bit of an and break someone's heart hurt people hurt people and then I thought well if you're a weak man and you're going through life and you don't
1:44:46
have the strength and resilience to resist the trials and tribulations of being a man and you're constantly hurt by everything and you're constantly
1:44:53
upset and depressed and sad because you're weak how could you possibly do good hurt people hurt people right
1:45:00
to do good you have to be a good person to begin with and to be a good person you're virtuous and you've gone through a lot of things that made
1:45:06
you strong this is what's mind-bending to me that the idea that strong men are somehow bad
1:45:12
and it's the ultimate hypocrisy because as soon as something happens especially physically
1:45:17
as soon as uh liberals attacked they call the police defund the police call the police
1:45:23
don't be masculine police officer they want a big strong man with a gun
1:45:29
s are bad they want him to have one right so the ultimate hypocrisy on every level
1:45:35
is absolutely gnarly insane at the base realities of humanity the absolute-based reality strength in men is respected and
1:45:42
wanted and I think that the closer you get to unfortunate circumstance the
1:45:47
closer you get to reality they go hand in hand and then everyone's looking for the strong man
1:45:52
so strong men should always lead I believe and for a longest period of human time that's how Society functioned
1:45:59
the strongest men LED but in the Western World now that doesn't seem to be the case anymore and weak men
1:46:04
are emotionally LED they're not particularly stoic
1:46:10
they are impulsive and I would say that the most heinous acts perhaps that happen in modern
1:46:16
society today are purported and committed by weak men I don't think a school shooter is a strong man
1:46:21
I think it's a weak man I think it's a man who's been picked on butt hurt is upset girls don't like him
1:46:27
never learn any emotional control he's the kind of person who does exactly what the TV tells him to do act out your
1:46:34
feelings cry when you want to cry well now he's angry so now what you told him to act out his feelings what do you
1:46:39
expect him to do I think that weak men do the worst things I think weak men hurt women I think weak men Rob stores because they
1:46:46
don't want to wake up and work hard and go to work and do it the honorable way it's a weak man who goes and steals it's
1:46:52
a weak man who beats the shadow of a girl he's a weak man of school who shoots up a school this is all weak men stuff
1:46:57
and society as a whole is telling men to be weaker and weaker saying it's somehow the solution to everything because being a man is toxically masculine being a
1:47:04
strong man is bad it's toxically masculine to be a good man you have to be a very weak one well look at the most
1:47:10
heinous acts that are committed in society show me a strong honorable virtuous man of principle who's doing any of this
1:47:16
stuff so weak men commit the atrocities in this world absolutely they do and it's weak men who
1:47:24
also attack anybody a virtue because I think when you're weak you're intrinsically unhappy yeah I don't think
1:47:30
as a man you can be happy if you're weak I think happiness and strength go hand in hand yes I think that's how we're
1:47:35
supposed to be right even strength of Mind strength of conviction strength of something if you're weak you're going to be
1:47:40
miserable so I do find satisfaction in the fact that most of the men who truly dislike me are miserable and weak
1:47:47
and also like I said earlier about women being Gatekeepers women are fantastic women are a fantastic
1:47:53
they're like a barometer for Psy I would say you can measure the strength of a society or the virtue of a society
1:48:00
or how decayed a society is largely by the actions of many women I'd like to argue that point I can argue
1:48:06
that point in many different ways but women really want their man to be strong of course
1:48:11
they will punish you for being weak and I'm not saying you can never cry to your woman I'm not saying you can never
1:48:17
open up to your woman but there's going to become a time where she expects you to just be capable there's a problem and even if you don't
1:48:23
know how to fix it your job as a man is to say I'll handle it even if you have no money and no hope and to go find a
1:48:29
way to fix the problem if you're a weak and go I don't know I don't know she becomes very resentful towards you
1:48:35
and she'll punish you for that that weakness and I think what she's trying to do on an evolutionary standard is
1:48:40
inspire you to man up because it's your job to protect her isn't it so if she sees you and looks at you and
1:48:46
doesn't see you as a man who could protect her she can't respect you so every survey of female happiness in the west shows a just a straight decline
1:48:53
since about 1970 till now women are becoming less happy in the west I think it's very obvious what accounts for that
1:48:59
how can you be happy when all the men around you aren't men right we are the most beautiful Union that God has
1:49:05
possibly created on the planet a feminine woman and a masculine man it's the most
1:49:10
beautiful Union that can possibly exist it raises children the best it both parties are happier both parties gain
1:49:16
it's a net positive for everybody there's no negative there's no downside but if you destroy one side of the
1:49:22
equation then the other side is going to be completely unarly miserable and unhappy how as a woman can
1:49:28
you be happy if you can't find a man who you believe can protect you provide for you sticks up for you it has morals has
1:49:34
principles there's none of those men left so then what they do is just go from man to man
1:49:39
trying to find it and by the time they've been through enough men to maybe find someone semi-close to it they've been through too many men to ever be
1:49:45
happy and then you have the absolute destruction of Western Society we talk about why men don't get married anymore
1:49:51
I can tell you why I wouldn't want to get married in America I don't see the point in being married to a woman who's had so
1:49:59
many partners before me that she can't properly pair bond with me and then giving her the opportunity to
1:50:04
financially destroy me I think that would be a bad chess move and I do believe in marriage I think
1:50:10
society would be better if everyone was married I'm saying that if you're living in a immoral Society being a moral
1:50:17
person if you're not careful about it you can get wrecked if the game is rigged you have to be very careful if you play it
1:50:24
so how do we encourage men to get married well they need to be worth marrying but so do the women right so
1:50:30
everything's decaying on both sides everything's spiraling one of the reasons I also got called misogynistic and I'll say it here
1:50:36
I argue the point that for the longest period of human time evolutionarily women had to adopt and
1:50:44
find a way to take the ethos of an opposing tribe perhaps
1:50:50
quicker than a man could because of War if the man would come and if the men would fight in a tribe lost and the
1:50:55
women survived they had to change how they thought to fit in with the new tribe to survive yeah because they'd be
1:51:01
carried off because they'd be carried off of course like the French women were sleeping with Nazis towards the end of
1:51:06
it towards the end of Paris occupation all the French were Nazis when the Nazis got kicked out the French women had all the
1:51:12
other heads shaved because they got caught hanging around with German soldiers the German soldiers killed their husband
1:51:17
three years later they need to eat so the German soldiers have a wage he's handsome
1:51:22
it's amazing how quickly they can adapt and that's for their own Survival that's fantastic but then if you extrapolate
1:51:28
out and you understand that to be true then you also understand that women are more susceptible to programming to a degree I gotta call Mr misogynistic by saying
1:51:35
that if you sit 100 men and 100 women down in front of propaganda I believe that women are more likely to believe a
1:51:41
lot of that I think a lot of Liberals are female they're more emotional and they're and it's easier to convince them of something if you use an
1:51:46
emotionally LED argument right so if by extension you now have women who are emotionally LED who are
1:51:53
being convinced and their logic is failing because they're being tricked with an emotionally LED argument and the man they're meeting has no principle and
1:51:59
no honor and he can't resist that she's in charge of the house well now she's telling the man what to
1:52:04
do right if I would have come home during covet and my woman said you need to wear a mask I'd say no I don't
1:52:10
end of conversation but revolves a sin you need to wear a mask okay baby don't all right
1:52:17
so the women are also largely in charge of the psyop because the men are so
1:52:22
desperate to get any kind of connection with a real person and avoid the porn screen and then these women are being
1:52:28
controlled by the mass media as a whole I say this to uh
1:52:34
I have children I don't talk about it often but I said to the mothers of my children I say look either we program their minds
1:52:40
or Society does who do you believe in everyone is being programmed by somebody somebody in
1:52:46
something me you everybody we're all programmed by someone to sit and think you're above programming is is incorrect
1:52:52
what you have to do is sit and say does the person who's programming genuinely have my best interests at heart what do
1:52:57
they want me to believe why do they want me to believe it what happens if I believe what they want me to believe where does this lead that's all we can
1:53:03
do we're all program we're all the sum of the five people we spend the most time with right right so if you have women with no father
1:53:11
no strong masculine influence who's programming them the Kardashians and the news
1:53:18
the internet porn stars what kind of woman is that going to be
1:53:23
and then if a man finally ends up with her and he has no backbone what kind of man is he going to be I
1:53:29
don't want to comment on these things because I don't want to make personal enemies of people I don't know there's a
1:53:34
guy called adam22 once again I have no idea who this man is I just saw on Twitter yesterday
1:53:40
that he was with a porn star who'd never done a male scene they got married and like a week after
1:53:46
their marriage she did her first male scene with some random dude and he's on a podcast defending it
1:53:52
did his wife had sex with somebody else correct why like this this is the level you can
1:53:58
this but this is what the Matrix wants from you as a man they want the woman in charge and the man below with no
1:54:04
backbone because if the woman's in charge they can emotionally affect her they can scare her you can scare a woman easier to scare a man a man a real man
1:54:12
is hard to scare a woman you can make afraid of the vaccine right be afraid covet be scared if she's in charge of
1:54:19
the household I would argue in nearly any household where the female was dominant everyone's vaccinated I would
1:54:25
argue that point hard of course maybe I'm wrong but I would argue it I don't I don't have the statistics this is logic
1:54:30
to me so talk about women being unhappy what's actually interesting about the female
1:54:35
mind once again they're going to call me misogynist is that when you're an emotionally LED person
1:54:41
you're more prone to chaos it takes real stoicism to lead
1:54:48
so why are these women unhappy because no one's leading them no fathers no man of no backbone no man they respect so
1:54:54
they're relying on society which is promoting chaos and their own mental state women will say all the time oh my period
1:55:00
was coming up so I was crazy like they'll say that themselves
1:55:05
so without any kind of hard rock of emotional security to give her a hug and
1:55:11
say don't worry baby calm down it's okay when you're not when you have no hard rock of emotional security and you leave
1:55:16
her to her own devices she's going to be to a degree chaotic and you know who told me this a woman said this to me a woman said this to me
1:55:22
a woman said most women are closer to her mental breakdown than you'd possibly believe day by day I was like really she goes
1:55:28
yeah and that's that's what I love about my husband he makes me feel happy and secure and safe if I'm starting to have a problem I
1:55:34
know I go to him and he makes me feel sick he's my rock there's a woman said this to me a long time ago yes
1:55:39
so why are women miserable because where are they going to get their happiness from where their emotional stability from it's not their job I don't believe
1:55:46
it's a woman's job to be emotionally stable it's a woman's job to do many other very important things that men can't do more important they're better
1:55:52
than men at a lot of things women are but it's our job to be emotionally stable women are better than us at
1:55:58
certain things we're better at other things and that's why as a team we're so powerful to sit and pretend we're all the same the whole way through then why
1:56:03
do we even need each other anymore well I don't think we do you're exactly it and this is why we have birth rates declining porn women who are running
1:56:10
around sharing one man with no intention of having children marriage is gone like where do we think this is going to end
1:56:16
and what's interesting about it ends with the training thing right well complete well yeah that's the ultimate I'm I'm serious though is I mean if
1:56:22
there's no I mean scrambling the idea of the gender binary of sex differences
1:56:29
like that that is kind of the end point well the end point is yeah men are the same as women so it doesn't even matter right I could be a woman today could be
1:56:36
a man tomorrow none of it matters anymore I also think a large part of this transsexual movement I think a large
1:56:43
part of it is a deliberate attack on us and our senses because they're trying to convince us to ignore our eyes I do
1:56:50
believe that is a bottom line I think the bottom line of slavery or are your own senses
1:56:55
like no matter what I'm told that it's cold outside I feel warm that
1:57:01
is my that's the bottom line so once they can convince you that your senses are wrong well then you're
1:57:07
completely open for the slave program once you can look at something with your eyes and ignore your eyes you're a prime
1:57:13
candidate so I think a lot of this has also something to do with that you are gonna say that's a girl that's what you are
1:57:20
going to say because you have to and if you say it long enough you'll think it and if you want your children will
1:57:27
because we'll tell them So eventually you're going to say it and then it becomes true then you ignore your eyes
1:57:33
now you believe anything right so the next thing comes along now you'll believe all the people on the Jets tell you about climate change
1:57:40
it's all an attack on the senses this is America's most famous Admiral
1:57:47
you know it's it's so such an important issue for our youth and adults as you
1:57:52
said some of these laws are actually extending into adulthood you know we often say that gender affirm and Care is
1:57:58
Health Care gender affirming care is mental health care and gender affirming care is literally Suicide Prevention
1:58:05
care would that be your view as well I 100 percent agree
1:58:10
it's so it's genuinely I want to actually genuinely give my heartfelt condolences to any young person who
1:58:15
falls for this crap because you're going to be so miserable for the rest of your life if you chop off your genitals take a whole bunch of chemicals as a teenager
1:58:22
you are going to be miserable for the rest of your life yes you're never going to be the person you want to be you're never going to be accepted as that
1:58:27
person you're never going to feel happy inside if you fall for this I genuinely feel sorry for you
1:58:33
that's the first thing I'm going to say the third thing I'm going to say I find it very interesting that the only
1:58:38
surgery we call affirming is gender surgery imagine a girl woke up and said I was
1:58:45
born in the wrong body because my tits are small I'm a big kitten woman if I was born in the wrong body I need
1:58:52
gender I need a tit affirming care I need to affirm my true body shape
1:58:58
otherwise I have a mental health problem no it's it's it's it's it's plastic it
1:59:03
looks good perhaps whatever but we would never say she was born in the wrong body and we had to affirm her genuine Body
1:59:09
Experience her triple d's yeah yeah her triple d's had to be Affirmed
1:59:15
it's garbage you're not affirming anything and also I think it's kind of interesting they say that trans people
1:59:20
commit suicide at a higher rate that's sad nobody should kill themselves I would hate for anybody to kill themselves
1:59:26
they say that's because they're picked on for being trans I don't know why anyone's ever had the
1:59:31
argument that perhaps they have a mental instability before this trans stuff and that's why they're
1:59:37
more prone to suicide in the first place seems like an obvious explanation seems like an obvious explanation
1:59:42
I don't think it's normal for anybody to want to mutilate themselves I I think if someone were to come to me
1:59:49
and say I really want to cut my hand off I would think they had a mental illness why don't like it
1:59:54
maybe you don't like it I don't like my hand I don't want it I would think that's very concerning so I really truly feel sorry for any
2:00:03
young people who fall for this I don't blame them I think it's a massive psyop and I think
2:00:09
if you fall for it you're gonna be miserable forever and I one more point I'll make on this whole
2:00:15
thing I found very interesting I'm a professional fighter so I spent a lot of time in Thailand when I was
2:00:21
fighting kickboxing was big over there and I've always thought no one's ever mentioned that Thailand has a bunch of
2:00:26
ladyboys right but if you say to a are you a man or a woman she goes I'm a
2:00:32
what's that I'm a man but I'm a they don't see themselves as women in
2:00:38
the real sense of I am female they don't want to compete against women in sports they don't want to pretend they can have
2:00:44
kids they don't talk about having periods they're like I'm a it's like kind of like an in-between it's got its own thing India has the same yeah
2:00:50
it's fine nobody over there is genuinely arguing that they are actually female
2:00:57
only in America are we doing that and that's what's the craziest thing of all even if you truly truly believe you
2:01:03
need to change gender and you truly believe it's the right path for you and you believe you're not being psyopped and you believe you're going to be happy and you believe you need to mutilate
2:01:09
yourself that's all fine but then to come along with the hubris and arrogance to tell me that I have to
2:01:14
pretend you're something you're not yes biologic that's right that's absolutely not really arrogant you can't tell me what I have to call
2:01:22
you right I'm allowed to come to my own conclusions and opinions and the whole point of being a human
2:01:27
is that we've gone through life long enough to identify patterns imagine humans didn't identify patterns one
2:01:34
person went and got ate by the lion you watch it happen then you go for a turn like no you work out over time Don't Go
2:01:41
Near The Lion right if I look at a person who's six foot four muscularly built
2:01:46
right with a big jaw and a beard my brain and my life experience tells me
2:01:51
that's quite often a man that's very often it is very often that's the conclusion I've come to to
2:01:58
come along and say no because I've decided to do XYZ you have to ignore all of the patterns you've identified throughout your entire life and
2:02:04
everything you believe to be true you have to throw away all the science in your entire world view and everything about how you view the world you have to
2:02:09
eject that from your brain and call me what I want to be called is extremely arrogant and if I went
2:02:16
through the world and said everyone had to call me King Andrew they tell me Shut up why if they can call whatever they want I
2:02:22
should be able to get called whatever I want I want to be king Andrew number one savior of Earth climate change activist
2:02:28
that's what I want to be and if anybody calls me anything else they're a bigot that's what we're going to do we're gonna go down that path I'm gonna make
2:02:34
sure that my title is good Lord of all lands of Lord of all Beasts of the land
2:02:40
and fishes in the sea the most honorable man who's ever lived the fastest human alive who cares doesn't matter that I
2:02:47
can't run fastest it doesn't matter Tucker I'm the fastest human alive you must affirm my belief the fastest man
2:02:54
alive greatest man in Show Business sorry Tucker best political commentator there's ever
2:03:00
been let's just go down this path of insanity why not walk around stickers on our head be great be fun the scariest
2:03:07
thing about all this stuff is that the world is still polarized to a degree because there's certain places in the world which are too close to Baseline
2:03:13
reality for survival for any of this garbage to fly you think you can go to Tajikistan where people are trying to
2:03:19
eat and talk to them about gender and all this garbage they're like listen you're a man this needs doing shut up
2:03:25
right there's no time for any of that so as the Western world is self-destruct
2:03:32
just as is self-destructing in real time there are places in the world where none of this crap is happening
2:03:38
so who's going to own the world in 100 200 years like it's still competitive to a
2:03:44
degree still bipolar it's there's two sides to the world I think that when men are men and women
2:03:49
are women and we stop arguing about dumb that Society overall is more competitive
2:03:55
I don't know how America is going to maintain its influence over the entire planet when it's doing all this garbage
2:04:00
how long can this possibly last not long not long it's like the fall of Rome
2:04:07
the fall of Rome everything became decadent endless sex and orgies no one had enough faith in the state to
2:04:13
join the Army anymore and people talk about barbarians destroying Rome Rome was destroyed from the inside
2:04:19
that's what happens and we're witnessing it in real time and we have all these problems on Earth and then they want to
2:04:25
spend millions and millions of dollars on an investigation to prove that I'm a human trafficker for tick tock it's
2:04:31
clown world there's nothing nothing even makes sense anymore this is a video from a recent
2:04:36
Pride March in New York and I'm interested in your view of it
2:04:53
so I have a few points on this the first point is that it is an unfortunate reality and I'm not
2:04:59
going to be called a bigot I'm going to talk about the reality that the homosexual Community cannot reproduce in and of themselves
2:05:05
so for them to have a community into the future they do need your children that's how they think
2:05:10
for there to be a homosexual Community 100 years from now they need straight people's kids
2:05:16
because only straight people have children so they're very they're telling the truth that's the first thing they mean
2:05:22
what they say the second thing is I think a lot of this is an attention grab by them I
2:05:29
think they are slightly disappointed in how tolerant many people actually are I have no problem with gay people I don't
2:05:35
care I'm gay cool I want to get married fine
2:05:40
I'm gonna wave my dick in your kid's face wait a second yeah they push it to a
2:05:46
point where we have to react and then when we react they say we're bigoted children are innocent and destruction of
2:05:51
innocence is one of the most disgusting things on the face of the planet it's terrible if a child is killed in the war it's terrible if a child's mind is Warped by any propaganda mechanism
2:05:58
they're innocent what I don't understand is why imagine a heterosexual men walked around naked
2:06:04
saying we're coming for the children well someone gets shot absolutely so why is it when you're a good reason
2:06:10
completely so as soon as there's a sexual orientation they're completely protected
2:06:15
and I think that the whole point of having children as a whole is to instill them
2:06:21
with your worldview I know if I have children I want them to be like me we just talked about my last name and how I want them to honor me into my into
2:06:28
post-death then I want them to be a representation of me which means they should believe in my
2:06:33
values and my Creeds why is a group of people in New York walking around telling me what they're going to teach my kids and what my kids should believe
2:06:38
they're not your kids they're my kids right and that's what's so scary because children are impressionable and children
2:06:44
are raised by the state and the internet effectively which is why they want me off the internet
2:06:49
they want but they'll let a lot of people stay on the internet that say a lot about a lot of things I'll argue that if I was transgender the American
2:06:55
Embassy would have told Romania they were bigoted and removed me pretty quickly I'll genuinely
2:07:02
argue that point they would say no what you're doing is is abusive to the LGBT community he must be
2:07:08
removed from Death of course immediately immediately but because I'm straight and heterosexual and it doesn't matter we're
2:07:13
the we're the class that suffers the biggest the biggest bigotry that possibly exists
2:07:20
in in the western world today I would actually argue that point but they're saying this to be deliberately provocative provocative they're
2:07:26
deliberately trying to upset people they want to upset you so that when you talk against it you they can call you names
2:07:32
and call you a bigot and also they mean what they say and it's it's truly scary
2:07:39
I'm obviously a Muslim I'm Islamic what most people don't understand about a lot of the Islamic world is that a lot of
2:07:46
these things are outlawed right but people say ah so gay people can't go there if you go to Dubai you will see
2:07:52
gay people you can if a guy wants to be gay and do whatever he wants to do with the full grown man in his own house I don't care and you can tell you might
2:07:58
have a waitress gay whatever Etc the only reason it's outlawed is not to stop a man full-grown man meeting a full
2:08:04
grown man and doing what he decides to do it's outlawed to prevent it bleeding into society and affecting the culture where the children are affected that's
2:08:11
why it's outlawed and I'm not saying it should be outlawed in America but what I'm saying is if you're not going to protect the
2:08:17
innocence of children from any ideology and if the ideology is deliberately
2:08:22
targeting children because children are more impressionable and more capable of believing in things which simply aren't
2:08:28
true perhaps a man a man looking like a woman or vice versa then that is a dangerous ideology that
2:08:34
should be very closely examined well if you're not going to protect children or if you're going to encourage women to fight your Wars why have a society in
2:08:41
the first place well this is another thing the whole point of society to protect women you know what's really interesting I argued this point once
2:08:47
they were talking about how the West is a patriarchy and it's so terrible to be a woman in the west and I'm like well where's better to be a woman then if
2:08:53
it's not the West please tell me pick another country besides America where you'd rather be a woman it's garbage to begin with but you're
2:08:59
saying oh America's a patriarchy and Americans are all misogynistic and men are so bad and women have been oppressed
2:09:05
since the beginning of time it's always been a patriarchy if that's true why don't women fight our
2:09:11
Wars think about it we can get the women of our country and the women of another country and let them go die in a ditch
2:09:17
and us men can just sit around being Patriarchs why do we have to go die why do we have to go get our legs blown off
2:09:22
no because we're patriarchy women can go suffer or do the women get to stay at home and we go suffer how's that a
2:09:29
patriarchy right so that's garbage to begin with but I think genuinely to go back to that
2:09:34
point any ideology which is waking up and saying our worldview is so extreme
2:09:40
the only way we can truly ensure exists into the future is to find the most susceptible people on the planet to
2:09:47
program and attack their minds children I think that's a destructive ideology
2:09:53
you should be very closely looked at it doesn't matter if it's lgbtq or anything else I think if you sit children down and and
2:10:00
pump propaganda into their brain and that's the only way you can get what you want then there's probably something wrong
2:10:07
with your ideas because you're afraid to challenge them with a grown adult you don't want fair fight
2:10:12
you understand they don't want a fair fight they want to sit with a child who has no idea what he's talking about and tell them that men are women and women
2:10:18
are men vice versa I'm just completely confused a poor child because they don't want a fair fight against a rational adult and that's scary it doesn't seem a
2:10:25
huge improvement over say Isis to me absolutely that's how how do you convince somebody to blow themselves up
2:10:30
will you find a young man teenage boy and your program is mine exactly and it's exactly the same thing they don't
2:10:36
try and convince an older man to blow himself up because he's going to sit there and go why don't you blow yourself up and then there's an argument you're
2:10:42
gonna find a young susceptible person right and that's what's so scary about all of it and and it's also kind of funny that
2:10:48
like this whole lgbtq thing is also linked to the patriarchy also linked to all this other garbage and all these
2:10:54
other false narratives and false ideas and it's these people who are attacking me saying I'm dangerous for women
2:11:00
because I'm a misogynist you're dangerous for women for pretending men or women you're more dangerous for women
2:11:05
than I am I'm saying a man is a man's a woman's woman you're saying that if I put a wig on I could go punch women in
2:11:11
the face in the boxing ring who's dangerous for women and again they have no virtue at all
2:11:17
they just weaponize garbage and attack you with it but I do think that children have to at least be the bottom line for
2:11:24
society that's the future and if you have children at home you're raising them and if you struggle to feed them
2:11:30
the government doesn't care they are yours and they're your problem and your responsibility and you deal with all of the stress and all the worry of them
2:11:38
being out late at night and all the responsibility of taking care of them and you went through hell for them to
2:11:43
exist you don't owe their minds to anybody else you don't owe it so there has to be a point where you stand up and
2:11:48
say no I raised this child it's my child that's my child it's not yours absolutely what do you make of Julian
2:11:54
Assange I think that it's crazy
2:12:00
it's the number one way to shut up the BBC that's for sure to mention him say oh you're a journalist you care about
2:12:05
journalism do you care about fair and independent story why is Assange in belmarsh very interesting what do they say they
2:12:12
don't answer they try and change subject they always do I did it I stole it from the azerbaijani president he started I
2:12:19
saw that yeah that's great do you know him I don't know him but I've seen I've seen enough of his interviews to like him me too yeah I like him and this is
2:12:27
what I'm saying about the world there's so many places in the world where they still live very firmly in the real world
2:12:32
all of this garbage is just the result of the very simple easy lives that we
2:12:37
have inside the movie The Matrix which I recommend you watch the agents say we tried to create a Utopia for the human
2:12:44
mind so that your mind is in a utopian State and your body can just be used but the
2:12:49
human mind rejects Utopia we created the world in 1999 at the Pinnacle of human
2:12:56
civilization before machines took over because the human mind needs struggle and it needs problems otherwise it rejects it yes and I kind of feel
2:13:02
there's a whole bunch of people trying to just find problems and find struggle in their lives because they don't have enough motivation to do something that's
2:13:08
genuinely difficult like you know help people but they can't live in this state of complete vegetation so then they wake
2:13:14
up and say oh I'm oppressed my pronouns how much energy must it take
2:13:21
to go through life trying to correct every person you interact with to call
2:13:26
you Z I think of the calories burnt I can't
2:13:31
think of a bigger waste of time because the calories burnt every Starbucks employee is actually Z correct you are a
2:13:41
and you are just wasting so much energy you could put that towards
2:13:46
something beneficial you could volunteer you could do you could go to the gym there's so much more
2:13:52
you could do with walk instead of walk around talk about Z you sound like a dumbass but they're just finding struggle
2:13:57
because they don't have any actual importance struggling in their lives and that's why I only exists in the
2:14:03
decadent West do you think the coming famine will change that I absolutely I would argue that when the famine comes
2:14:09
I think all these feminists will look for a strong man of resource who is stoic
2:14:14
who has a good Network who's capable and important and respected it's amazing how
2:14:20
quickly feminism disappears in fact there's a podcast I did called Fresh and fit and I did this podcast in Miami and
2:14:26
I was arguing about gender roles with seven girls and during it they were telling me that they can do anything a
2:14:31
man can do all the usual things and they don't care they don't need a man all this garbage and some crazy fan knocked
2:14:37
on the door for me and he had a gun he knocked on the door you should have seen the women how
2:14:43
quickly they became feminists when I had to go to that door they all completely changed go go go go oh the feminism's
2:14:51
out the window there's no feminists on the Titanic there's no feminisms in a famine there's no feminists at War
2:14:57
where's the feminists go to war right I remember when Afghanistan when we did
2:15:02
that very well planned very thorough evacuation of Afghanistan and all the schools that we opened for
2:15:09
women got shut down by the Taliban and I was having this conversation with someone and I was saying okay well
2:15:14
you're an Afghan man right you've been hired by the Afghan Defense Force and America's now left
2:15:19
and you have a meager wage and America's left and the Taliban are coming and you're standing outside of the school
2:15:25
with your AK and they're coming with whatever they've got and you're looking at the school going do I really want girls to go to school that bad
2:15:32
not really just put it down you walk off and this girl's like yeah but you know it's really important and I'm like yeah
2:15:38
it is very important I agree women should have education right the education completely agree but you're also saying here that men should die for
2:15:44
it which is fine I'm not saying that shouldn't be the case but I'm saying then you should give men the respect they deserve for dying for your
2:15:50
education because it's not the women who are going to defend that female schools to men so if you're gonna on men all day long and say we ain't worth anything
2:15:56
until the war comes and then you want us to go die that's interesting when the famine comes
2:16:03
the closer reality gets towards Baseline survival the closer we become towards
2:16:08
our gender roles because it's the only way we can be competitive if you took 10 men and 10 women and Stranded them on a
2:16:14
desert island the men would be men and the women would be women because if they didn't they would die that's the bottom line
2:16:20
and I think that if you look at history since the dawn of time men were masculine and also Men by and
2:16:29
large were generally ruling the society not on an oppressive way but in a protective
2:16:35
way and I think that that means that makes Society most competitive and my argument
2:16:41
for that is that if you name any society since the dawn of human time men were protecting women providing for women and
2:16:48
basically in charge of the society and these are societies that never met so it can't be an idea that spread the Ming
2:16:53
the Ming Dynasty and the Aztecs they're pretty far away but that's how Society was most
2:16:59
effective and when feminists argue with me and say we need a society run by women so that's never ever happened and
2:17:05
if it has happened they got destroyed so quickly they never had a history we can't even name one
2:17:10
so it's a brand new idea which I'm not saying is a bad idea I'm saying if it's a brand new idea you
2:17:15
can't tell me it's going to be better because it's never been tried ever so we're gonna see but what happens if
2:17:21
it doesn't work with the most powerful Nation on Earth right so we're feminizing men and women
2:17:27
have more and more control and more power which is fantastic I'm saying this is untested who knows where any of this is leading
2:17:32
and our competitors the America's competitors are still very firm in their gender roles
2:17:38
so it's certainly an interesting period of History you're about to enter it's very interesting what's your view of tobacco
2:17:44
I love tobacco so my diet is particularly strange I've been told I
2:17:52
live on caffeine and nicotine so I eat once a day I eat dinner only 80 of my calories come from meat I have
2:18:00
10 cups of coffee a day and three or four large cigars so I like caffeine and nicotine I do too yeah it makes me feel
2:18:06
good uh makes me feel like my blood's on fire a little bit caffeine and nicotine I think are fantastic and but you're a
2:18:12
health guy obviously I'm a health guy but um smoking is mass is fantastic for your testosterone level and I think
2:18:18
that's important in a man I think that's also important in the resistance of slavery you can feel it oh 100 and I'm
2:18:24
not saying that you know smoking's healthy I'm not saying that because I also train exceptionally hard every single day and when I was professionally fighting I didn't smoke
2:18:31
but I think in general testosterone level is a fantastic way to measure your overall health as a man but
2:18:37
but nicotine has a positive correlation of testosterone absolutely it's been proven yep it's been proven repeatedly
2:18:42
so that's why I love nicotine so much and then caffeine I love to have
2:18:48
that little bit of uh not Jitter but I like to feel energetic and I like to be hungry my optimal state is hungry but
2:18:54
energetic that's how I get the most done I don't like eating if I eat I feel full I feel lethargic I like totally yeah I
2:19:01
like to be hungry and one percent irritable for my fifth coffee and uh a bunch of nicotine inside of me
2:19:07
that's how I like to perform so yeah I think I think it's uh it's a good thing and it's interesting how focused the
2:19:14
people in charge are on nicotine because fentanyl becomes really common yeah 100
2:19:20
000 people die a year from it nobody notices but they're still trying to shut down not just tobacco but non-tobacco
2:19:27
nicotine devices yep why that's a really good point we could argue this down to testosterone level I don't know if you
2:19:33
ever saw the study which linked people's testosterone level to their ability and capability to disagree with something
2:19:38
so the ball they did a study which is pretty self-explanatory the higher your testosterone level the more likely you
2:19:44
are to disagree with a point and the reason for that is is because especially in older times if you're going to disagree with something you had to fight
2:19:50
over it yeah if you're going to say no to somebody or some tribe or some person there's a very like there's a high
2:19:56
chance that you're gonna have to fight that person you have to defend your idea if you don't have the propensity or the capability to defend your idea then why
2:20:03
would you go against the ideas of the people who are stronger than you so reducing testosterone levels make men
2:20:08
more compliant and more complacent because we're less likely to say no because we can't defend what we think why would we say you're wrong but we
2:20:14
can't do anything about it might as well say well then you're right Mike makes right right so reducing testosterone levels in men is something which I
2:20:20
believe they're trying very hard to do and if you read the studies they're succeeding testosterone levels have gone
2:20:25
off the off the edge off the cliff and perhaps that's why they attack smoking so heavily I understand that
2:20:30
smoking a lot of cigarettes can be very bad for you but I think everything in moderation and I think that overall I
2:20:36
would rather smoke a few cigars today and maintain my testosterone level which it's good for then then not I think the
2:20:42
the benefits outweigh the negatives couldn't agree more and my final
2:20:47
question uh is about digital currency yep or do you think it's inevitable and what
2:20:54
would its effects be cbdcs are inevitable and they're scary
2:20:59
they're super scary because it's the final absolute realm of control I mean they're already removing cash from society
2:21:06
I think they say that because they want to be able to trace things easier and that's certainly part of it but I also have another theory on it uh I think if
2:21:13
you have a 50 bill and I give it to the barber
2:21:18
for my haircut and then he goes and buys groceries with it from the grocer and the grocer goes and gets his car washed
2:21:23
a 50 goes from place to place and after 20 or 30 transactions the 50 Bill belongs to somebody and it's worth fifty
2:21:29
dollars whereas if I pay by card 1.5 goes to the bank
2:21:34
and then if he takes the money I've given him and pays for the groceries 1.5 goes to the bank and after the groceries have been paid
2:21:40
for when he goes to get his car wash for 1.5 goes to the bank so after 20 or 30 transactions fifty dollars has gone the
2:21:45
bank has it all I think that's why they're so desperate to get rid of cash it's interesting
2:21:51
cbdc is the next level because once the money's completely digital then they control everything you do with it they control where it goes but they can also
2:21:56
control how and when it can be spent imagine some terrible future
2:22:02
dystopian Society where your money arrives and they say it can only be spent on food or it can only be spent on
2:22:09
vegetables because you've had too much meat this week or you can't buy transport to a particular area because
2:22:15
there's resistance to government oppression in that area so that your your money won't work for trains right
2:22:21
now because nobody can go down there because we don't want everyone in a large group we want everyone at home in
2:22:26
their pods and they can track everywhere it goes and they can also track how it's spent and they can control how it's spent they
2:22:31
put time limit on it you have an hour to spend this money scary like think of all the ways that
2:22:36
can inflict control over it and I think this is actually one of the reasons why also I'm disliked
2:22:42
the BBC said this to me and interviewed me they said Lucy the very intelligent BBC reporter
2:22:48
said word for word you have a Bugatti and a cigar and that means it comes with
2:22:54
a side order of misogyny I said how does having a Bugatti and a cigar come with a side order of misogyny
2:23:00
and you can order misogyny on the side it looks like it it's like a sauce
2:23:05
and she repeated it because she couldn't yeah you have a Bugatti in a cigar and it comes with a side order misogyny
2:23:10
so I was like but they're not sending their best yeah they're I don't think they have any best to be honest
2:23:16
but the point they're making what she doesn't realize she's making because she's not smart enough
2:23:22
but what she wanted to say but she couldn't say in a way which sounded negative is Financial Freedom is
2:23:28
required for to a degree to resist the reason I'm also disliked is because I'm
2:23:33
financially successful if I was broke they wouldn't care what I say what I say but I Inspire young men all of my fans
2:23:41
to become wealthy and they and and you'd think that'd be fantastic for the society right he has
2:23:46
millions of young men he's teaching him to work hard he's teaching him different ways money can be made he's teaching him to be a fantastic salesman he's teaching
2:23:52
he's helping the society know because if you have a whole bunch of money then you can sit and say no I don't need your wage that's
2:23:58
there was a video very recently of a guy in England taking down all the English flags and putting up Pride flags and a
2:24:04
guy screams to him and goes bro you're taking down the wrong flag and he replied I know mate
2:24:09
and the point is what can I do I'm a flag flag guy if I say no someone else will
2:24:15
do it kids go to eat so by keeping your money enslaved they can keep you enslaved you've got to eat
2:24:21
they don't want men to be financially free if you're financially free if you have enough money in the bank you can one day go you know what I don't want
2:24:27
your money even me now to this day I've done enough and I'm successful
2:24:32
enough that they it's very hard for them to buy me they come along well I would never sell my soul anyway because it's not who I am
2:24:38
as a person but if I was destitute they could come along and say Andrew you have all this influence we're going to change your message you're going to say this
2:24:44
and we'll give you 10 million uh okay you can't buy me can't buy Trump
2:24:50
it's Rich already he's Rich he's rich and he's AE 70 something you think he needs more money
2:24:55
doesn't care about money they don't like that so being financially free in and of
2:25:01
itself is now an act against the government because this whole idea that they want everyone to be rich and it's fantastic for the society and I actually
2:25:07
argue against that they don't want that they want everyone destitute because when you're destitute you need the government to feed you and it's very hard to fight against the government
2:25:12
who's feeding you it's very hard to resist the people who give out the bread yeah yeah I think that's called something
2:25:18
begins with c what's it called interesting I also heard another interesting Theory
2:25:24
from a very intelligent person one day and it was that every government on Earth all of them
2:25:30
and all of their different forms China which says it's communist and is capitalist and all the different
2:25:35
in-betweens to the capitalist West every government on Earth is slowly
2:25:40
encroaching on trying to become as controlling as powerful as fast possible they all know what they all want to be
2:25:47
as controlling as possible over their citizens communism is the end result of the most control a government can have
2:25:53
effectively or some version of Communism but every single government on Earth is slowly trying to get there bit by bit
2:25:58
and the only thing that resists them getting there is to populace and how much the populace will accept and depending on how malleable the populace
2:26:04
is depends on how quickly they get there but every government wakes up it's kind of like AI have you ever heard the
2:26:09
robot's gonna destroy us all because they wake up and go we don't need the humans anymore their end goal is just survival
2:26:16
if a government is the same as an entity it's its end goal is more and more control and that's all they're trying to
2:26:21
do every single day with every law they pass with the climate change law they don't care about the environment they
2:26:28
want more control of course and the more and more control they get the final end result if you give them what they want
2:26:34
is absolute slavery for everybody so you have to be very careful because that is their ideal government the ideal
2:26:41
government is where everyone complies everyone obeys everyone's
