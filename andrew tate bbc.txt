so guys Andrew's just released a new interview with the BBC if you want to join the real world we have a link in
0:05
the description
0:14
you've agreed to do an interview with the BBC today yep the material is going to be published on television on radio
0:21
online perfect we are doing an interview with you
0:28
because you're facing some very serious allegations correct rape human
0:34
trafficking and also because there's a great deal of concern about the things
0:39
you say and the impact that they have on young people on women I don't think the
0:46
concerns about the things I say I think the concern is for the level of influence they have and the reach I have I would argue that a lot of the things
0:54
that are already out there inside of the Legacy Media The Matrix is all are far more damaging than the things I say concern about the influence you have
1:00
being a harmful influence but let's start with the allegations not necessarily a harmful influence the fact that I have I'm massively influential
1:07
over the and I understand that but it's my influence as a whole which people are afraid of not necessarily let's start
1:14
with the alligator have you raped anybody absolutely not have you trafficked anybody absolutely
1:20
not exploited any women absolutely not but you have admitted using emotional
1:25
manipulation to get women to work in the webcam industry for you no firstly let's
1:31
begin let's start at the beginning I'm facing charges the one the first one you mentioned the rape ones already started
1:37
out by a judge because there's no effort secondly it's very difficult for me to sit here and have a very Frank and
1:43
honest conversation with you while we're in the territory of Romania about illegal cases going on within Romania I have to protect myself I've agreed to do
1:49
an interview with you and I want to be as honest with you as possible but I can't incriminate myself in any way I have to be very careful with what I talk
1:54
about and I've agreed to speak to you but I
2:02
have to be as honest and Frank as I can while also protecting myself and following my legal counsel so let's talk
2:08
about
2:15
emotionally manipulated women to fall in love with you so that you could get them
2:21
working in the sex industry for your financial gain as I said I have to be
2:26
very careful with what I say but let's put it this way no women are coming out against me and accusing me of doing it yes they are no they're not yes they are
2:33
no they're not who there's testimony from the current investigation the current investigation which I cannot
2:38
discuss which I know intimately and you don't I can tell you right now that the late the women who are in this case File
2:45
there are two American women who have been caught already admitting their mind and then nobody else is accusing me of
2:51
anything to begin with it's very common in cases like this that the alleged victims do not always see themselves as
2:56
victims well that's very interesting it's actually extremely interesting because if I was a matrix controlled
3:03
organization my goal was to slander somebody and try and destroy their name you're telling me that they've chosen a
3:09
crime which one is heinous of course because it damages the person's credibility and two you're saying that even if everyone else involved if you
3:15
have five people and everyone's sitting there saying no nobody's hurt anybody we like Andrew we've all worked together we're friends Etc not what everybody
3:21
says no let me read you some of the testimony from the current investigation can I finish one of the witnesses said
3:27
can I finish this you're not answering the question I am answering the question you're saying
3:33
the people who are involved in this even if they say they're not victims that they're still going to try and attack
3:38
names treated as victims by a case that's ongoing and not all of
3:45
them are saying that one of the witnesses says we can't just we can't go into the case
3:51
the case is open and active well let's just be clear that not all of the Witnesses in the case are behaving
3:58
in the way you describe and even those that are it doesn't bother them from being treated as victims by the
4:05
prosecution by the case we have an open criminal investigation I am absolutely not really sure how we found innocent I
4:11
know the case better than you I know it intimately and you don't I have seen all the criminal files and the evidence against me and you haven't I know the
4:18
truth of what happened and you don't and I'm telling you absolutely not really I've never hurt anybody that the case
4:23
that's been put against me is completely not only fabricated and I'm never going to be found guilty of anything and it's very difficult for me to answer your
4:29
in-depth questions because we're sitting here inside of the territory of Romania I'm holding to the Romanian legal system and I'm not going to incriminate myself
4:35
because you're trying to Prague me you are wrong and we're gonna have to accept that for now and ask and talk about something else let me read you then what
4:42
you have said about what you have done sure you have said my job was to meet a
4:48
girl go on a few dates sleep with her get her to fall in love with me to the point where she'd do anything I say and
4:53
and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together I don't think that's what I personally said I think
4:58
that's exactly no that's that's no I've never said that that's something that you found on the internet doesn't mean
5:04
I've said it and and again once again if any female on the planet has a problem
5:10
with me I strongly recommend her to go to the police and try and pursue me for criminal charges it's actually very
5:15
interesting that me one of the most famous people in the world who's been vilified by the Legacy Media and places
5:21
all over the Internet while everyone has attacked me from every single angle while federal agencies multiple
5:26
countries have called over 2 000 women who know me we stand here with zero new accusations since my arrest zero if you
5:33
took any famous person any man of substantial wealth and you called 2 000 women who knew him he'd find an
5:39
ex-girlfriend is upset somebody wants money who's upset they called 2 000 people who knew me and could not find a single woman to make a new complaint the
5:46
only the only complaints they have against me are the initial complaints which we can prove our lives and
5:52
that's where it stands so I I'm not going to sit here and allow you to pretend that I'm some kind of evil Predator when actually I'd argue the
5:58
fact I'd argue the fact that people who've been investigating to the level I've been investigated to if you're taking the average man on the street and
6:03
investigate his entire life for 14 months call everyone who's ever known him and vilify him in the media and encourage people to come forward for
6:09
money and you try to contact every ex-girlfriend would come forward and accused those people of rape and accused
6:16
I think that you would have a lot more I think it would have a lot more Flack than I've got I'm actually such a nice person that I've never hadn't even
6:21
spoken to somebody sits your arrest who says exactly those things that with you it's all manipulation there's an
6:27
ulterior is this Sophie oh it's Sophie the the fake name no face
6:33
no one's got the story that was invented to please him and wanting him to be happy that I was just kind of yeah okay
6:39
do whatever you want and what does she accused me of a crime this imaginary Sophie she's making the point that there
6:45
is has she accused me of a crime emotional or psychological manipulation I've asked you a question and I've allowed you into my house I'm asking you
6:51
correct but you're not the boss here because I've allowed you into my house I'm asking you the question correctly and I'm telling you you get to decide
6:57
the answers no we're equal here I've allowed you into my house you don't come here with a position of authority I'm
7:02
doing you the favor Legacy Media giving you relevance by speaking to you and I'm telling you now this Sophie wish your
7:08
BBC is invented which is no face of nobody knows who she is of course not and she because you never invent
7:13
anything and she's not [ __ ] she's not filed criminal charges against me what are we talking about here what are you
7:19
say anything about emotional manipulation how she's the sex industry for your financial change absolute garbage she has not found this person if
7:26
they exist has not felt criminal charges against me I welcome anybody who believes I harm the male or female any
7:31
point in the past to file criminal charges against me I'll fight them I know who I am I know what I've done I know the truth and I know that I'll be
7:36
found innocent of this attack the reason I'm being attacked is because of my massive influence not because I've ever hurt anybody and for you to sit here and
7:42
say that everybody around you is saying you're Innocent but that doesn't matter because the state will say they're victims and they're just gonna
7:49
grab everybody you know and call everybody victims even if they say they're not and try and put you in jail
7:54
you are describing a matrix attack you're not describing human trafficking I'm describing women who are going to
8:00
court to accuse you of rape and human trafficking we will see what women do we will see what women go to court can I
8:06
finish trials we'll see which women go we'll see which one we live for I'm describing women who are going to court
8:13
to accuse you of rape and humans I'm describing women who have spoken to the BBC at length Sophie doesn't exist
8:19
and other media organizations about what they say is emotional manipulation and coercion and I'm quoting back to you
8:26
your own words where you describe the words you found on the internet and
8:32
Sophie doesn't exist so let's move on to the next subject move on to the next subject no I think I'll stick on this
8:38
one a minute so there's other places in that same website where you say you get girls to fall in love with you and they
8:44
do it because they love you because they want to do what you say convincing women to take part in some
8:50
kind of business Arrangement doesn't work long term because they're emotional you've got to get them fall in love with you once again that's emotional manipulation
8:57
that's abuse what you've found are clips from the internet some text from the internet and you're going to sit here
9:02
and tell me that that's the reason I should read your website your words it's on my website yes it is no it's all
9:08
check my website next it's the website you've taken down and I
9:14
wonder why those comments have been taken no websites no websites are taken down my website is the same it's been the same for a very long time the
9:19
comments on this down and I wonder why you are accusing
9:25
me I'm guessing what you're trying to say is you're accusing me and you're trying to say that I'm guilty of the things I'm accused of and I'm emotionally manipulating people I'm
9:31
saying that you have set you emotionally manipulated people here for your own Financial getting no absolutely not and
9:38
I'm asking you about that absolutely not is the answer I look forward to the end of this try I look forward to clearing my name I look forward to the BBC and
9:44
the Legacy Media having to say not guilty and having to tell the truth as I've said before the only other person
9:49
who's been found despite absolute rigorous destructive levels of
9:55
investigation and prodding into my life is this imaginary Sophie by the BBC who
10:00
doesn't exist and if you were to find any single other man on Earth and try and analyze his life forensically to the
10:06
level they've done mine you would find genuine damage to people I don't hurt people it's not just thousands of women have
10:13
come out in my defense thousands of women have come out my defense and you've not mentioned that thousands of women come out my defense
10:20
so the women accuse you of serious crimes okay let's agree that thousands
10:25
of women let's agree the problem that some people say you haven't done it it's a problem that
10:31
thousands of women come out my defense and as we stand right now we have an open criminal investigation people who
10:36
are involved in the criminal investigation are saying that we're not victims of anything Andrew's fine he's never hurt us you're saying no I have
10:42
the opposite to that I have to counter that I have someone called Sophie with no face a fake name who we've invented and she's not accusing you of anything
10:48
criminal so I don't see the whole point you're trying to say manipulate women they say you know
10:54
do you think I'm manipulating you given on your website and the testimony
11:01
you've printed something off that you found on Reddit and you're going to sit here and say that that makes me a bad person I'm saying that you should know
11:07
better as a journalist and do some proper journalism let's investigate the fact that you should answer my questions
11:13
I already have and we should move on she's just trying to start it's not only
11:18
about the criminal allegations it's a much bigger issue you've got children's organizations in the UK you've got rape
11:25
organizations in the UK you've got the police naming You by name as someone who has a harmful influence on children and
11:32
on women in the UK and elsewhere because of the things you say because of the way you present
11:38
gender relations the way you say men should treat women that's very upsetting and the reason that's very upsetting is
11:43
because I know that's not true I'm genuinely a good person I believe my impact on the world is positive in fact
11:49
if you were to read the comments section of nearly any video I post especially by the Legacy Media 95 of the population
11:54
agree with me most people know that things I say are positive Legacy Media as a whole has lost all its credibility in the last three to four years nobody
12:00
believes it and it's a shame it's a massive shame the BBC come here and try and push and purport this idea that I'm
12:06
a dangerous person I'm I'm anti-drug so I've never pushed drugs or any uh I'm anti-drugs romantic
12:12
violence we're the UK is facing a nice crime epidemic and they're going to sit here and say they're going to sit here and say that I'm the most dangerous man
12:18
in the UK only to the most dangerous man in the world I've said I'm the most dangerous man in the world
12:25
you've also said that [Music]
12:32
oh man the world and you believe that's when did I say that I'm asking if you believe it no you said you said you said
12:40
you're the most dangerous man in the world is that some kind of proof that I'm dangerous am I Dr Evil now I'm telling you that it's very upset that
12:46
you're gonna sit here and that certain organizations in the world are going to try and pretend that I'm the biggest force of evil on earth when I'm genuinely a Force for good I'm genuinely
12:53
a force for God and the and the reason they're doing this is because of the Mastiff influence I have over the youth and they don't like that I'm telling the
12:59
youth to think outside in The Matrix and ignore things like the BBC which come here with loaded questions and false
13:04
narratives and try and paint innocent people as as guilty you've said women's intimate Parts belong to their male part
13:10
I said that if a woman marries a man she she takes his last name and traditionally the man gives her away
13:15
I've been pushing traditional religious beliefs because I'm a religious man and
13:21
traditional beliefs in regards to marriage which everybody accepted 10 to 15 years ago that's not that's not
13:26
that's not a crazy conspiracy theory if you're going to sit here and say that me believing a woman should take a Man's
13:33
last name in marriage makes me the most dangerous man in the world then you're just going to lose even more credibility than the BBC's already lost in the last
13:38
four to five years if that's your point if that's your narrative sleep with a lot of women outside
13:44
marriage that doesn't sound very religious that's not what I said they should be able to I said a lot of high value men a lot of rich men do it and
13:50
then we discussed at length on podcasts why rich men do it and we also discussed why women decide to be unfaithful it's
13:56
not a gendered argument we discuss unfaithfulness as a whole what are the reasons and motivations for men and what are the reasons motivations for women
14:02
because you have no time to actually say it because you have no time to actually watch my content because you have no
14:07
time to actually watch my content at length and understand what I'm saying you just come here with a small snippet which we provided to you doesn't make it
14:14
true no completely you don't have a clue on what I say or what I talk about you never watch my content you have small pieces of paper small Clips on a piece
14:21
of paper and you're trying to pretend I've said evil things and then you're going to sound the most dangerous man in the world which is truly laughing you said
14:27
do you believe in the most dangerous man in the world well then we well then we need to change
14:32
the dynamic of this interview because and I'll make this clear I allowed you into my home I'm doing you a favor give you the first interview I'm giving to
14:38
the public you don't come here with a position of authority you're not the police I don't respect the BBC I don't know you you do not come here with a
14:44
position of authority over me we are equals we are people we're citizens of the world and we sit here as equals and
14:49
I see you as my equal and if you ask me questions I can ask you questions back for you to come here and sit down and pretend you're the gestapo and that you
14:55
don't have to answer my questions is is disingenuous because I don't owe you any asking questions
15:00
this is a conversation and I don't owe you any degree of authority over me so let's make that clear and that doesn't
15:06
matter if you're a man or a woman or for the BBC or the CNN I'm here to answer your questions and be honest with you and do you a favor but and I'm doing you
15:12
a favor but you come here with loaded questions you're trying to paint a narrative of me which is negative I'm asking you and that's fine you've said
15:17
that people are under balance and that's fine but you're not going to sit here and say you don't answer my questions because you're not above me
15:24
in 30 degrees absolutely it would help if you answered the question I've answered every
15:30
question so far let me ask you another question sure you have said that a woman's intimate Parts belong to her
15:36
male partner and if she goes on only fans he is entitled to a cut of her income you are extremely it's actually
15:43
very it's very con confusing to me why you're gonna sit here take long format podcasts I've done which are three or
15:49
four hours long in context where I sat with only fans girls 10 or 15 only fans
15:54
girls where we've been joking back and forth ignore every comment and satirical comment and sarcastic comment that the
16:01
females have made and then come along and say you said this and that you're the most evil man in the world I don't
16:06
know if you understand what sarcasm is I don't know if you understand what sarcasm is I don't know if you understand what context is I don't know
16:11
if you understand what's uh satorical content so you're saying it was sarcastic I'm saying it was a very interesting talk show and for you to sit
16:18
here and say that that is my true core beliefs and that makes me a bad person is disingenuous of course not was it
16:25
sarcasm absolutely you should watch the show you were being sarcastic when you said let me clarify you should watch the
16:31
show let me clarify for you audience you were being sarcastic when you said a woman's intimate Parts belonged to her
16:37
male partner no I didn't believe that no it's not that it's that you haven't watched the show at length and you
16:43
should have because the woman was saying my man's car belongs to me because he's my man and she was on only fans and then
16:49
20 minutes later when she said she was on only fans and said ah well you're selling your body that belongs to him because he's your man and she laughed
16:55
she laughed she laughed and she said haha yeah that's probably true if you watch the show if you watch the show it
17:03
will make sense for you to come here with doing no research at all and then say I don't understand what I'm talking
17:08
about but I've got this piece of paper with a few things printed off that's why you're saying the silly things you're saying you should watch the show do some
17:14
research do you believe it I've already answered the question not really of course I have yeah
17:21
do you believe that a woman's intimate part of course not I've just answered the
17:26
question yeah we've done that three times and and does this woman believe that her man's
17:32
car belongs to her we it's it's not a gendered argument I really think that it's genuinely sad
17:39
that when the BBC has a chance to finally interview me at the end of all this Matrix attack that they don't come
17:44
here with any kind of genuine openness to try and understand my influence of the world or the things I push or what I'm trying to teach the world or why I'm
17:51
a good influence on the world because I am the massively good influence instead they come here with pieces of paper with printed out excerpts from five-year-old
17:57
podcasts taken out of context to attempting the same to attempt the same Matrix attack on me which has been
18:03
attempted endlessly every single person Legacy Media has already tried this and
18:09
it doesn't work you I really encourage you I encourage you to read the comment section on the on YouTube when this goes
18:15
on YouTube and you'll see nobody believes a word you're saying the Reason God I'm asking you about these comments
18:20
is because we've got the chief executive of Rape Crisis naming you individually
18:26
as spreading a dangerous ideology of misogynistic rape culture absolutely
18:31
it's the comments you make that are leading people to say things like absolute National organizations who are
18:38
saying that blaming you for increasing levels of misogyny schools that are saying they are having increased
18:44
incidents of girls being attacked the female teachers being harrised if that was something if that was of you and
18:51
your teacher that's absolutely that's absolute garbage I have never ever encouraged a student to attack a teacher
18:57
male or female ever I preach hard work discipline I'm an athlete I preach anti-drug I preach religion I preach no
19:04
alcohol I preach uh no knife crime every single problem with modern society I'm against I'm teaching young men I'm
19:10
teaching young men to be disciplined to be diligent to listen to train to work hard to be exactly like me with no
19:17
criminal record never even yet charged in this 14-month Matrix investigation and I'm saying that men grew up with me
19:23
which are hard-working and diligent and it's emotional control and stoic we're gonna have a better Society not a worse Society to sit here and say that schools
19:30
in England England which is a failing nation which has knife crime going through the roof violence going through
19:35
the roof men's mental health going through the roof and they're gonna all blame me because I appeared on the internet one year ago it's disingenuous
19:41
it's disingenuous and also also financial success a cigar but it comes with a side order
19:47
of misogyny how does having a Bugatti and a cigar come with a misogyny because it's all mixed together in what you
19:53
teach you teach that a woman if woman is in with the machete shove it is that
20:00
what I teach that's what you say no if you actually watch the clip it will be about the woman attacking me with a
20:06
machete as usual you've not watched the video taken out of context flipped it and attempted it to attack me with a
20:12
small exert let me tell you something Lucy I'm sure you're a very nice person I'm sure you're a fantastic person but if I were to take everything you've ever said online and just take small excerpts
20:19
out of context I could make you look like a misogynist I guarantee it in fact I might actually do that and then you're
20:25
going to sit here and say oh [ __ ] I'm a misogynist because my Clips have been taken out of context if you refuse to
20:30
wash anything at length and understand it then that's what's going to happen the National Police Chiefs leave for violence against women the nspcc Rape
20:38
Crisis safer schools they are all naming you as being behind an epidemic of misogyny
20:44
even amongst primary school children the idea that I made primary school children misogynistic because I own a nice car is
20:51
that is that your right is that your argument oh holding a nice car is misogynist no it's the misogyny that comes along with
20:57
it how does misogyny come along with only a nice car because you you're you have an image of financial I'm glad
21:02
you're answering my questions now we finally got the name I have an image of Finance actually you have an image of Finance
21:11
that are really problematic my attitudes towards women is that women should be protected and provided for and I've said that at length in fact I've said that
21:17
over 50 times online you never mention it I say that my girlfriend doesn't have to work unless she wants to I take care of her I die to protect the woman I've
21:24
talked about how I've stood up and faced a knife to protect a woman you want to over her and the way you have over a
21:31
child or a dog absolutely not I've said that women should be protected and provided for and I in return you want
21:36
authority over her because if you have responsibility for someone like a child or a dog you say you have authority over
21:42
them if you want to go down this argument we'll go down this nuanced argument I said that if I have responsibility for her safety I should
21:48
have a degree of authority over her safety meaning meaning and let me explain my point if I'm the one who has to fight and die to protect her I'm the
21:55
one who decides how we walk home I'm the one who decides the group we take because it's unfair for her to say I want to walk to the most dangerous
22:01
neighborhood in the world but you have to fix the knives that's what I've said and now you're going to sit here and pretend I'm trying to treat women like dogs which is garbage every single man
22:08
every single man in the world who loves this woman understands that he has to protect her and every single woman in
22:13
the world likes the idea of a woman of a man who would protect her if you were to say to most women home right now do you
22:20
want your husband to protect you in a violent attack they'd say yeah of course nothing I've said is no swimming would
22:26
you want to lose Authority in the relationship to not be treated as a free and legal equal to your I didn't say
22:33
that I said I need to have authority over the route we walk home when you compare women
22:41
authority over a child or a dog it's not the same because a woman is a free legal
22:46
adult correct you're equal it's free legal adult my equal but if I had a girlfriend and we were walking home late
22:52
at night and I said let's not walk down the area it's a bad area I protect you everything happens I want to take the long way and she said no I will I have
22:59
to walk this way even though it's the most dangerous room I must then what then I would say you're welcome to you could do it you're a free legal equal
23:05
but I'm not going to walk with you and protect you I think that I should be able to decide the route because I have an obligation and my obligation is a man
23:12
is to protect and provide for females everything I'm talking about is Gen is traditional gender roles which 10 years
23:17
ago less than 10 years ago would not be considered outlandish would not be considered crazy would not be considered
23:23
dangerous or misogynistic the world has changed and a lot of people haven't changed with the world please understand there's a lot of women at home watching
23:30
this right now I like the idea of their man sticking up for them protecting from them protecting them and providing for them and just because the world has gone
23:35
crazy and the Legacy Media has gone crazy most people at home were still relatively sane and these are the people
23:40
who are going to write on the comments that Andrew wasn't saying anything
23:49
this is invites the whole world believes these things
24:08
that's fine I'm having a nice conversation with you so I'm enjoying so it's no problem it's
24:16
been fun so far it's fine
24:28
we good yes I can do the clap now we're good thank
24:35
you if a man broke into your house and you want your wouldn't you want your husband to protect you there's a difference between conservative values
24:42
emotional control we're talking about protection and I'm saying if someone broke into
24:47
your house would you want your husband to put that too it's not about conservative values or protection is what you're demanding in return for that
24:54
well I'll give you this I don't know who your husband is I don't know if you would say enough to protect you would die for you but I'll give you this if someone broke into this house right now
25:00
it was a homicidal maniac I would expect me and the other men in this room to stand up and face them while you were the win you and the other women in this
25:06
room could protect yourselves I would actually believe the men should go and engage the attacker I believe that and even though I don't know you and you've
25:12
come into my house with a hostile agenda and you've come here to try and make me look bad I would still stand up I would still
25:18
stand up to protect you I would still stand up protect you because I believe that's my role as a man I am asking about
25:30
you about my name that's what I'm asking you it's not what I say it's not about whether you protect your partner or not
25:36
it's about what you have said that has caused such concern in the UK and I want to put it to you that you don't really
25:42
care about the harm it calls that's not true it is because that's not true making controversial statements like
25:47
this online has made you a lot of money okay so first thing I genuinely am a Force for good in the world you may not
25:53
understand that yet but you will eventually and I genuinely believe I'm acting under the instruction of God to
25:59
do good things and I want to make the world a better place I genuinely believe my legacy is a good Legacy and I believe
26:05
that eventually when the Legacy Media catches up they're going to understand I'm a good positive influence I'm not interested in damaging the world for
26:10
money because if I was interested in damaging the world for money I could have sold drugs or I could make rap music and encourage everyone to stab
26:15
each other like all the drill artists do you can make controversial statements online that attract a lot of follow followers who you then direct to your
26:21
website I could make jokes I mean I could make I could make jokes online who doesn't I
26:28
mean I can make a joke are you saying that all the controversial things you've said no I'm saying that these organizations and the BBC are going to
26:34
sit here and pretend I am the face of damaging the youth is absolutely garbage it's completely disingenuous and the
26:40
reason and the reason
26:46
s I'm sorry I have reaches and I'm talking
26:51
right now so these are very limited questions is not what we discussed it's not a
26:57
conversation that we agree we're very good at the questions
27:03
this is all assets have been provided so if we could please move on from this side of the
27:09
interview I would appreciate it I would like to hear what Andrew has got to say about the fact that when you make
27:15
controversial statements it attracts people to follow you and then you direct them to your website
27:21
where they pay you a monthly fee to learn how to be like you and so the more controversial statements you make the
27:28
more money you get the fact that that's the path you've outlined to one my online university and to my presence on
27:35
the internet the fact that you believe that's the path just shows you've done absolutely Zeroes
27:42
genuinely zero research okay so how many of the people have who sign up for Hustler's University come to you through
27:48
your social media genuinely how many of the people who sign s University come to you through your
27:54
social media where you direct them to the website and Lucy I encourage you to go out there do some genuine research watch my videos watch of course watch my
28:01
videos at length and truly understand what I'm doing how many of the people who sign up for Hustlers University at
28:07
49.99 a month come to you because they see your social media comments there's
28:13
an online store University which I don't own I influence
28:18
Thor along with many other influencers and they sign up for your website which I don't own and once again once again
28:24
once once once again there's nothing to do with me and you're gonna sit here and say that I made a joke I made a joke
28:29
online four years ago because a woman said that she owned her man's car and you made a joke and that means that you
28:35
because you have a Bugatti and the most misogynistic dangerous man in the world this is going down a path of absolute Insanity it's not true none of this is
28:41
true I don't hurt people I don't harm people I'm genuinely a positive I'm I'm renowned for offensive
28:49
I'm actually actually we're now helping young men because we talk about those men's Mental Health crisis we talk about we pretend
28:55
to care that men are upset but as soon as I discuss men's issues it's misogynistic it doesn't have to be gender just because I believe men have a
29:01
point of view and men have rights and men are allowed to think and believe and act a certain way that helps them internally that doesn't mean it's
29:07
anti-female in fact I believe it's actually Pro female I think when a man is true to his influence and true to his
29:12
Essence and he's good within himself he's a positive influence in the world he's positive for the women around it just because I discuss men's issues
29:19
people say oh you're anti-woman I'm not anti-woman I love women why are so many women saying that when their boyfriends
29:24
start following you they're not they experience more control so many they experience more abuse how many enough
29:33
enough enough well that's the first time I've heard of it so in fact one is too many oh of course yeah so of in fact
29:39
I've seen thousands and thousands of comments and have endless emails from women praising the fact praising the
29:46
fact that their sons are listening to me it's praising the fact that the things I'm saying does not worry it would worry it would be concerned about it it would
29:52
it would worry me if I was genuinely damaging the world but for you to sit here and say Andrew you become the most Googled man in the world you have
29:57
billions of views and one woman one is now saying that her husband is not the same man she wants him to be when
30:03
thousands and thousands of people are saying the opposite well then I would say that that's going to do with case after case after case with quotes after
30:09
quotes after quote if people genuinely concerned about the
30:14
you have done is come here with an agenda you've come here with loaded questions you've come here with things taken out of context you come here with
30:20
things that you don't understand it's satirical and then you're gonna also sit and say that one woman said that her boyfriend changed when he watched one of
30:26
your videos and and then I don't know what you expect me to say to that that's fantastic and jokes no that's how you
30:32
explain for you to sit down you'd like to apologize for any of that for you to sit down
30:38
for you to sit down it's fine no it's fine it's easy for you to sit down and say that one woman said
30:44
that I'm with her boyfriend watching Andrew take video and now he won't do the dishes or whatever your argument is
30:50
and that I'm somehow the worst most dangerous man in the world beside the car it's just disingenuous and I'm
30:56
enjoying this interview very much because this shows this shows the world it's great it shows the world the truth
31:02
about the Legacy Media because they beg me for interviews they beg me you have been begging me for months please we
31:07
need to be relevant and then you come here with loaded questions trying to paint a picture of me which is completely and utterly false I am a good
31:13
positive influence for the world the things I teach men are stoicism discipline self-respect hard work
31:19
obeying Authority listening to your fight coach working hard in school making as much money as possible in your
31:25
job if you actually watch the things I say if you actually watch my comments about women I've done long podcasts for
31:30
hours long about females talking about protecting for them providing for them how I believe in women should be treated in a relationship I've done all of this
31:35
but you don't watch any of it and then you come here and ask me that answer questions I've answered at length thousands of times since you came out of
31:42
custody there seems to have been a lot about your charity work correct on your social
31:48
there's all I've always done the charity work but now I'm promoting it there seems to be a real shift yeah I wonder
31:54
what's behind that well I've always won the charity work I've been doing the charity work for years I believe that it's my legacy to the positive influence
32:00
on the world and I've been doing charity work for over five years post my incarceration my unfair unjust
32:07
incarceration post that I've made it more clear the charity work I'm doing but this is again once again very interesting I spend 25
32:14
million dollars a year feeding children men male children and female children in in turkey and Syria and Iran and Iraq I
32:21
literally spend 25 million dollars a year feeding children and I'm still the worst man in the world because four
32:27
years ago I made a sarcastic comment because some people that and say okay so before you got money from attracting
32:34
people to your website by making controversial comments but that might have got you into trouble and so now
32:40
you're looking for a new market you're looking for a new market of followers who are attracted by a different sort of
32:46
persona I've always done the charity work so that is obviously correct and I have proof that I've always on the Sherry work so you're firstly I believe
32:53
that if you have a lot of wealth you should help people and I'm helping people I honestly think it's very very interesting that you cannot find another
32:59
celebrity in the UK or anywhere else who's spending 25 million pounds a year feeding children in war-torn countries
33:05
I'm doing that I've been doing that for a long time without even mentioning I never even said it and now that I've
33:10
said it people are going to attack me for it and say that it's disingenuous the person in Sudan who's eating the
33:16
meal do you think they believe it's disingenuous no I think they I think they feel pretty good that Andrew take fed them and to sit here and say that
33:22
I'm a bad person now because I'm manipulating charity because I'm using cherry I'm just trying to do good in the
33:28
world that's all I've ever been trying to do when women speak out against you online disagree with what you say they describe
33:35
being bombarded with rape threats and death threats trolley by your followers
33:40
would you like to say anything to your followers about how to behave and that's absolutely correct I would love to do
33:46
that first things first I've yet to see a female stand up and arguably online I don't ever see hardly any although only
33:51
women who message me agree with it secondly I don't think that anybody who disagrees with me male or female should
33:57
be trolled I don't think they should be insulted or attacked I think the idea should be discussed openly and fairly immaturely it doesn't matter if a man
34:02
agrees with me or disproves me or a female I don't think my followers should come along and attack her and if my followers are doing that I'm upset by
34:08
that but let's make a very important clarification that's not my followers that's the internet if you were to log
34:14
into any video game Lobby I don't play video games and some were to sit there and say something stupid they would be trolled with similar comments that's the
34:20
unfortunate reality of the internet as a whole that's nothing to do with me but I encourage all of my followers to open to
34:26
engage in open discourse and be fair and honest and talk in a way which is mature there's no need to control anybody male
34:31
or female
34:40
to consider whether or not he would like to apologize or
34:47
um give a you know an indication of how he feels
34:53
about the allegations that he has negatively influenced young people in the UK the second thing I think we
34:59
should put on records that this interview is taking place in your house because you're under house arrest if it
35:05
were not for that then we would between us so I think that's just worth
35:12
it okay um so just to put on the record then you've
35:20
said that you've invited us into your house we're here because you're under house arrest correct if you were free to
35:25
leave we would have negotiated a more neutral setting don't you think as the BBC it'd be very interesting to come
35:31
here and discuss the fact that I was put in a dungeon for 92 days and then locked in house arrest without charge do you
35:37
think that's a far more interesting conversation than old YouTube Snickers don't you think that would be interesting you're here under house
35:45
correct I've been incarcerated without charge and don't you think has been dropped
35:51
correct so I am I'm incarcerated without charge and I think that'd be a far more interesting conversation than I guess
35:57
Julian Assange is incarcerated without charge and nobody's interested in that either so if you actually wanted to do some genuine journalism and
36:03
investigation we could talk about the fact that an innocent man who has yet to been charged with a crime has had his Liberty deprived of him and I think that
36:09
would be a far more interesting angle than talking about me being the most dangerous man in the world because I own a car
36:14
and this question about schools being very worried about your influence Boys in primary school or you know boys as
36:21
young as 11 are quoting you at school attacking girls refusing to respect female teachers
36:28
would you like to say anything about I'd like to say law first things first as
36:33
I've repeatedly said and the only reason I keep repeating is because I'm sure this interview will be edited I am a
36:39
positive force of the world I teach children discipline I teach the world discipline male or female of any age and a lot of women listen to me as well 40
36:45
of people listen to me are actually female secondly I do understand with my massive influence and I am now the one
36:51
most influential people on the planet that I do have to be slightly more careful with things I say I'm not going to disagree with that the idea that I
36:57
said something five years ago on a video that got 300 views so what do you mean being slightly more careful I'll give you an example
37:03
some of the jokes I made four or five years ago on a YouTube channel they got 300 views I would no longer make like
37:11
the only fans joke the one you mentioned repeat when she said my man's car is my car and then she said she did only fans
37:17
and I said what you saw an only fan she said my tits and I said well those are your man's tits as a joke hahaha
37:23
everybody laughed the point the fact that I could do that on a podcast five years ago it only got 300 views now I
37:29
understand I'm the most influential man on the face of the planet I would be more careful with certain things I say that doesn't mean the things I
37:35
originally said were genuinely out to harm people do you really believe you're the most influential man on the face of the planet I know it's Google person on
37:41
the planet do you believe you're the most infamous on the planet
37:47
I think we're done yep
37:54
thanks Lucy it's enjoyable nice to meet you
38:03
