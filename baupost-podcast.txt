Seth thanks so much for joining me it's great to be with you thanks so much for having me I'd love to go all the way
Childhood
3:14
back to your first memories of your interest in business and investing well
3:20
it goes way back to Childhood maybe even early childhood I was always starting small businesses I was a micro
3:26
entrepreneur in the sense of doing Leaf raking and lawn mowing I had a snow cone
3:33
stand and got in trouble with the Baltimore Health authorities when we added hot dogs so that's a snow cone
3:38
stand because we didn't have a license and I was having little carnivals in our yard for kids and built a mini golf
3:45
course in my yard although my mom didn't really appreciate that had a tiny interest in collecting coins and used to
3:53
buy and sell some coins by males a mini activity as well so I was just doing a lot mostly just getting my feet wet and
4:00
learning a lot my main interest was in the stock market I was a numbers guy I
4:05
loved the baseball statistics I was always turning the Baltimore Sun papers to the sports section they would have
4:11
every batter in every pitcher in the American League and all their stats and
4:17
I was learning how to calculate those statistics as well and at some point I noticed there were a whole bunch of
4:23
numbers a few pages after the baseball statistics and I asked my dad what those
4:28
were and found out those were the stock exchange listings and so it just began another journey of trying to connect my
4:35
interests to figure out what was going on and what was that all about I read a
4:40
bunch about the market I remember reading a book about how I made a million dollars
4:46
in the stock market I remember reading how to buy stocks by Lewis Engel so kind
4:51
of up and down the spectrum of what was out there how old were you when you bought your first stock
4:57
I bought a share of Johnson and Johnson when I was around 10 years old with
5:02
money I got from my birthday a few days later it split three for one which I didn't know had been announced but it
5:08
must have been announced a little bit before that so I owned three shares of Johnson and Johnson why'd I buy it I
5:14
knew what the company did and you got to start somewhere my mom found me a very kind stockbroker named Max Silverman
5:22
down in Baltimore and he was happy to execute an order where he couldn't possibly make any money and he was my
5:29
stockbroker for a number of years but it was always at a very small scale where
5:34
did that take you as you got older you know went through college so I was really fortunate my Uncle Paul my
5:41
mother's brother lived in New York and he was a tax attorney and an old old friend of Max Haina who was a Founder
5:49
head of mutual shares my uncle introduced me to Max when I was Junior in college and I got a job for the
5:56
summer and then ultimately an offer to come back full-time when I graduated which was in January of 79 so that's how
6:04
I got to Mutual shares and my history there I continued to hold stocks trade stocks and read but the key was getting
6:13
that job it was a value investing mutual fund Mike Price had started by then and
6:19
was Max's Protege and running a lot of the activities day to day it was like
6:24
being let in on a secret that you could read about it all you want but when you actually start doing analysis and you
6:31
see individual companies trade at a discount from what they're pretty obviously worth it's easy to get excited
6:37
that there's some inefficiency here and you have a chance to really add value and do well what was your first aha
Picking stocks yourself
6:45
moment from having picked a bunch of stocks yourself to now working and seeing a philosophy behind it the most
6:53
clear thing was that picking stocks yourself you knew what the companies did I knew that Johnson Johnson made
7:00
bandages which I apparently was an extensive user of when I was a small kid but I didn't really know how to connect
7:07
that to anything tangible about why would I pay a particular price or what would make that stock go up or down so
7:13
being in the business and watching every day and seeing some of the peripheral
7:19
things like you can't just assume that just because the stock trades at a price or a bond trades at a price that you can
7:25
actually buy any there because it's a market and maybe you can buy it and maybe it's not that liquid or maybe by
7:31
the time you get around to deciding what you want to buy it's moved a lot so there was just a lot of nuts and bolts
7:38
that all went into the entire equation Mutual shares was a great place to sit
7:43
because Max Haina had in his office this old railroad Bond Trader Hans Jacobson
7:50
you hear all these names that they're bit getting various prices and you
7:55
really have no idea what lies behind that but eventually it became clear that a number of them were U.S railroad
8:02
bankruptcies several connected to the Penn Central bankruptcy which was unfolding around that time and which led
8:09
to the creation of a bunch of other Securities it turns out of course that railroads had been granted building
8:16
rights over the tracks and that they had all kinds of real estate value in addition to any value they might have as
8:23
a railroad and so there were just a series of Securities that went from
8:29
obscurity because you'd never even heard of them into mainstream at least for
8:34
somebody sitting at Mutual shares because they started to make sense and you understood why the prices fluctuated
8:40
and why they might be really attractive as an investment I also remember the
8:45
first stock I believe Michael price threw a prospectus on my desk and said here figure this out which was a typical
8:52
Michael price instruction to me a company called telecore which was an
8:58
Electronics distributor was losing their contract with the Japanese company whose
9:03
products they were Distributing and they were going to get bought out for the value of networking capital or something
9:10
like that telecore also owned a subsidiary called Electro rent which the
9:16
rented and leased the same kind of electronic equipment so you were going to get eight dollars or so in cash over
9:23
a period of time but not that long and you're going to receive share of a
9:28
lecture and a fraction of a share of electorate and a lecture rent at that valuation that you could created for was
9:35
trading at under one times earnings and that was math I could do in my head and
9:42
math that made the nature of that inefficiency seemed so glaring and so obvious and probably was a great example
9:51
for me of complexity can be an Investor's friend that if a person
9:56
wanted to buy electron previously they couldn't the only way to get it was this way that most of the time you wouldn't
10:03
want to pay eight dollars and change to create a share of something that is only
10:08
worth sense in that most of the money you were just going to get back from the liquidation payment end of the licensing
10:15
deal with telecore nevertheless it was a great lesson that there are Arbitrage
10:20
opportunities that the complexity leads sometimes to opportunity that you need to really soak yourself in the details
10:27
that opportunity may not immediately be apparent it certainly wouldn't be apparent from reading a financial report
10:33
from last year because that's not an ongoing concern but rather understanding
10:38
how the pieces all come together using your own ideational thinking to understand what might get in the way is
10:45
there an approval needed or are some payments owed to somebody that you've got to subtract before you think about
10:51
your proceeds or their taxes is due on the transaction it was really a broadening example of the kind of things
10:58
an Arbitrage investor needs to think about compared to an investor and a going concern
Efficient Markets Hypothesis
11:04
so as you're learning early on in your career it's also around the same time
11:10
you had the bill Sharps of the world writing about efficient markets hypothesis and I'm really curious as you started
11:17
hearing about that thinking about the markets and Index Fund investing and then on the other side you're seeing all
11:22
these security level inefficiencies how did you think about the investing World more broadly
11:28
I read a book after that but quite a while ago called to conquer the air and
11:34
it's about Orville and Wilbur Wright and they're building a flying machine in the early 1900s at the same time as they
11:43
were trying to build an airplane you had a guy named Langley at Smithsonian also
11:48
trying to build a flying machine and he was the respected guy he was a academic
11:53
and famous and everybody thought he would succeed and it all made sense in
11:59
theory but the Wright brothers went down to Kitty Hawk where the winds were strong and where they could experiment
12:05
with what the winds might do to any particular kind of flying craft and how
12:11
the wings of a airplane might be the same or different from the wings of a bird and how you might maneuver in the
12:17
air Langley's machine eventually was launched I believe off of a river and it
12:24
was all set to launch out over the water and fly except it plopped in the water never to be seen again and the Wright
12:31
brothers over a couple of Summers figured it out and I say that because it seems to me it's the same thing that I
12:38
always thought there are these academics sitting in their institutions writing out theories and in theory it makes
12:47
sense it might be Yogi Berra who said in theory every Theory works but in
12:52
practice a lot of them don't the academic idea was logical that there are
12:57
transaction costs and there are a lot of competitors and even when there aren't
13:03
that many even one competitor can reprise some mispricing but had they
13:08
chosen instead to sit down at the trading desk of mutual shares they might have seen what really inefficient
13:15
markets look like and realize that what's true in theory isn't true in practice in every case the first book
13:22
that I read about the efficient market was malcol and it was about the random walk on Wall Street I appreciated what
13:29
he was trying to say but I also knew that was just silliness and what's interesting is it was true in the same
13:37
way that they mused in that book you could try to imagine what it would
13:43
be like to ride a horse by sitting on the fence and observing a bunch of horses in the field or you can go get on
13:49
a horse I think it's as simple as that that you need to be creative you need to be curious you need to be not afraid to
13:55
fail willing to think outside the box and maybe you'll come up with something as you're learning at Mutual shares back
Going to Business School
14:02
in the day how did you make the decision to go to business school it was actually really tough I enjoyed Mutual shares
14:09
immensely I loved sitting side by side I was literally next to Mike Price and right around the corner of the trading
14:16
desk for Max Hina and I was the only analyst it was literally the three of us and a bunch of Traders admin people it
14:23
was such a wonderful learning experience and I was soaking it in on the other
14:28
hand I had a sense that top business school would be a good place to go it would round me out I may have known more
14:36
and more about stocks but I didn't know a lot about business and so to study business to try to understand what's a
14:43
good company what makes a company great how to think about running a company upside the challenges was certainly
14:49
appealing and I ultimately thought it's not going to be a negative it's probably going to have a lot of positive and it
14:55
will make me better investor if I decide to stick to investing I also wanted to rule out that there was something else
15:01
I'd rather do although I kind of suspected that investing was my thing so I did investing before took a summer job
15:08
at Solomon Brothers just to see what investment banking was it was very popular back then and a lot of people
15:14
were going in that direction and I didn't think I'd love it but I figured I'd try it and actually had a great
15:20
experience I enjoyed the young people at Solomon Brothers and I met some of the partners who stayed in touch over the
15:26
years but I realized that investing was where my heart was so as soon as I
15:31
graduated I had an offer to go back to Mutual shares but serendipitously had an opportunity to come in at the ground
15:38
floor of bell post being formed and that's what I chose how did that come about
Joining Bell Post
15:44
I had a professor of real estate and I took his course at some point he called
15:49
me in to talk about a test I'd done in my exam but what really had happened was
15:55
he and some friends had a stake in Channel 5 in Boston Channel 5 at the
16:01
time was being sold to Metro media for a pretty fancy price at maybe the highest price for a TV station up to that point
16:08
and he had decided that he'd want to join with a few other friends some from the TV station one not from from that
16:15
background and create an expanded family office this was the early 80s so it was
16:20
an era of bank failures and rapidly Rising interest rates and inflation and
16:25
in some ways a general distrust of the financial system and where should you put your money in how could you make
16:31
sure the taxes got paid and the coupons got clipped and all of that so at the
16:38
exact same time that I was graduating this plan was in motion Outpost would have been formed with me or without me
16:43
but my coming along maybe changed the trajectory and they realized the original plan was to hand out the
16:50
capital to Smart money managers and in the earliest days of Bao post when I
16:56
joined after I graduated in May of 82. I went to New York a bunch and met with money managers and thought about well
17:03
would this one be good to hire would that one be good to hire what's the playing field look like it revealed a
17:09
lot but it also ultimately led to the decision that we would actually be better off managing the money ourselves what did it reveal among other things it
17:16
revealed a great deal of group think everybody's favorite stocks were the same stocks everybody was buying Warner
17:22
Brothers back then because they owned Atari there was a lot of excitement around video games as there has been
17:27
excitement every few years about something different in the market and then shockingly to me how few of the
17:35
managers of money actually put their own money in the same product that they were expecting their clients to be in and how
17:42
important that alignment is it's one of the main reasons valpost didn't invest with any of those managers would have
17:48
realized that people talked a good game but they didn't put their money where their mouth is and why eating home
17:54
cooking is such a foundational principle of outpost where still today the the
18:00
employees and their families are by far the largest client on a collective basis when you went to launch bow post you
Value Investing
18:08
were instilled in the early years in what was called and probably still is value investing we'd love to hear how
18:14
you define value investing the key definition for Value investing comes from Graham and Dodd and the idea
18:21
of it is that because markets are inefficient prices deviate from value
18:27
and that deviation sometimes they fall below underlying value and that makes
18:32
them a value investment it makes them attractive other times they get too full value and maybe even significantly
18:39
exceed it at which point you should have sold and if you were inclined to be a short seller perhaps shorted it the
18:46
principles made sense I was probably too literal in my earliest understanding of
18:51
gram and Dodd which I'm sure I read the intelligent investor first being the more accessible of the two books
18:57
security analysis came later but I think what I was applying was not gram and
19:03
Dodd value investing but Mutual shares value investing so I was already looking
19:08
at special situations looking at broadly across the landscape to equities but
19:14
also to arbitrages and to credit and in the case of these railroad bonds distress credit so I think it gave me a
19:21
good analytical grasp rather than being pigeonholed into one single asset class to understand that investors can look
19:28
broadly across the landscape and if you can figure out a stock for example why can't you figure out the value of the
19:34
entire private business if you can understand a bond why can't you understand a bank loan or convertible
19:41
Bond or a municipal bond for that matter perhaps one backed by a piece of real
19:47
estate there was just a lot of learning there that the broad scope was attractive and perhaps also valuable for
19:54
an investor because the ability to move Capital into whatever was attractive maybe sometimes stocks were high but
20:00
Bonds were low or sometimes stocks and bonds were both high but real estate was low that was also a piece of the
20:06
thinking one aspect of what you originally read of Grandma Dodd did you
Warren Buffetts Super Investors
20:12
stick too closely to I was too enamored of Book value when you think about Book
20:17
value you need to go back to the founding principles era in which gram
20:22
and Dobb were writing so security analysis came out in 1934 first edition there's description among other things
20:30
of the super investors article that Warren Buffett wrote in the Columbia
20:36
business school magazine in the early 60s and the super investors article
20:42
looked at several investors all of whom were familiar to Buffett and how they'd
20:47
all had exceptional performance now I'm not sure this was a perfect scientific test because not all of them maybe had
20:54
previously been identified nevertheless they followed General value principles
20:59
in their investing and they followed them very differently one followed bigger cap companies and another
21:04
followed smaller Gap companies and one was Global not just the United States and so you saw at least the idea that
21:12
this approach might apply in a variety of places and then Buffett also in that article makes the observation that value
21:18
investing is something not everybody is comfortable with but that it's like an
21:24
inoculation when you get introduced to the approach either it makes sense and you get it or you don't and I felt like
21:31
that inoculation had taken with me that it made complete sense that people have
21:36
trouble being patient and holding out for their best opportunities to show up and not just plunging in Bill Ackman
21:43
once said to me that value investing in a classic senses like watching paint dry but I bring a hair blower
21:51
I I thought well that's a good definition of activism and certainly I'm not one to just want to own stocks
21:57
forever and sit on them forever there are times when it actually can be challenging in effect the hard thing
22:04
about investing in general is the market tells you you're wrong all the time that the very reason that you can find a
22:09
mispricing the very reason that you can find a market inefficiency that causes the stock to go to a discount might well
22:16
still apply after you own it and it might go to a bigger discount and that's not lost on gram and Dodd that's right
22:22
there in security analysis but the idea of that is perhaps there are ways you can speed it up maybe you can apply Bill
22:29
ackman's hair dryer into the process one of the things that bowel post has done over the years we follow the basic
22:36
principles we're looking for bargains we're patient we're disciplined we're willing to say no a lot as Warren
22:42
Buffett says we're not afraid to just leave the bat on our shoulder and not swing but at times you do swing and then
22:49
you've got to be comfortable with some of the important elements of value investing you've got to be comfortable that a bargain can become an even bigger
22:56
bargain and this is what resonated with me maybe the most if you look to the market for feedback the market might
23:02
regularly say you're an idiot you bought it now it's down you don't know what you're doing but the reality is you've
23:09
got to see that a little bit differently you've got to see that as the market is now offering you a better bargain either
23:15
you have confidence in yourself or you believe in the market as giving you valuable information and then as Graham
23:23
and Buffett say if you look to the market for the answers you're going to just be following popular opinion but if
23:30
you look to the market as a Mana counterparty that sometimes sells you something at a big discount from what
23:35
it's worth and other times pays you more than it's worth now you're talking now you're going to be able to take
23:41
advantage of the erratic Market to profit as an investor a lot of business
Lessons from Graham and Dodd
23:46
businesses you could buy in the form of stock or assets you can buy they're not static values things change over time
23:52
and I'd love to hear a bit about from those early lessons of Graham and Dodd how you've thought about adapting the
24:00
way you apply evaluation to businesses and assets Graham and Dodd lived in a world where I
24:06
believe there was considerably less technological innovation there wasn't none over that period of time we
24:12
invented radio and refrigeration and air conditioning eventually and Automobiles
24:18
decades before but a lot of innovation but there was no Venture Capital
24:23
industry these Innovations often took a while to take hold the rollout was slow
24:29
it wasn't like downloading software at a click with no cost of goods sold when
24:35
the economy suffered when a stock became mispriced in the 1930s it was almost
24:40
certainly because we were in a depression and that there was a cyclical downturn grandma died knew that they
24:48
wrote about it which I give them huge amount of credit for and they wrote that it would not be reasonable to assume
24:54
that depression will always be the circumstance and yet they couldn't know when it would end or if it would get
24:59
worse before it got better that also by the way resonates with me because I think the idea of financial rating you
25:06
can write a newsletter I suppose and try to be right for the next two weeks or you can try to write something down and
25:13
say to yourself what is the essence of this that's going to matter not just months from now but
25:19
years and decades and maybe even a century from now just as Graham and Dodd are applicable 89 years after it was
25:26
written in 1934 what might we say about what we're writing today that will still
25:31
be applicable in 89 years so I at least think that lens is really important and
25:36
that to me is what gives that book historical significance that nobody's saying follow their exact formula or go
25:45
Page by Page and you'll know what to do the companies are all gone they've been merged or liquidated decades ago out of
25:52
existence many of the principles that they talk about are based on laws at the
25:57
time around prudent man rule or other regulations that no longer apply but
26:02
what's still applicable is that despite all the changes the general principles
26:08
which are essentially dependent on humans and their psychological Tendencies to get overly exuberant and
26:16
to get overly depressed and to have constraints on the humans you must buy a
26:21
highly rated Bond you can only own a stock that pays a dividend you cannot own a stock below a certain market cap
26:27
or below a certain share price and those kinds of rules and constraints can lead to inefficiencies and so while the
26:34
nature of the exact inefficiencies may have changed a lot in 89 years the certainty that there will be those I
26:41
think remains high and I actually am pretty optimistic that they will remain even if computers are replacing people
26:48
as money managers and we're doing all the trading and that's because the nature of what causes the inefficiency
26:55
it's human but I think the computers will mimic what the humans would do
27:00
because that's what they're trained to do and so I think that even AI wouldn't
27:06
make the markets fully efficient there is a degree to which AI as you get closer to general
Artificial Intelligence
27:12
intelligence tries to replicate how humans would think where do you think
27:17
as computers on the short end say of trading and then AI maybe over time
27:23
replicating thinking will still go wrong relative to human behavior
27:28
a caveat that anything to do with technology you've got the wrong guess and that I need to know about it I need
27:36
to be up to speed I need to have an opinion about where it might go but I'm not an early adapter I don't fool around
27:43
with it the way some people do so my opinion may not be as good as some people's but when I think about it first
27:50
of all my understanding of AI is that it is trained to look at enormous amounts
27:56
of past data I don't fully understand how that is done because for example up
28:03
until 2022 we'd hit the longest bull market in history and so depending on
28:08
what period one looked at one might think well the absence of a bull market maybe we're past that is that right or
28:15
is it pent up that the absence of a Down Market the straight up 12 years of bull
28:21
market that ended in 21. it's like if you're waiting for a bus and the buses as you know from the schedule come every
28:27
15 minutes and it's been 45 minutes so either four or five buses are going
28:33
to come right away or the road has collapsed and no buses are coming which is it what will the computer tell you
28:40
which is it those are hard questions I don't think humans will always know the answers I think AI will be amazing at
28:47
saying oh well when the Suez Canal gets closed by an attack of some sort here's
28:53
what happens to oil prices or here's what happens to GDP around the world in the next quarter
28:59
or when there's a war in Europe here's what happens and computers will figure that out and humans would have a ton of
29:05
work to catch up and maybe computers will see connections that aren't easily seen but how will a computer figure out
29:12
the next telecore and Electro rent electron hasn't been public there are no published financials yet although
29:19
they'll be in the proxy eventually I don't know how they'd know what telecore shareholders would get or how to think
29:25
about the contingencies around those kind of liquidation distributions and
29:30
that's not the most complicated thing that could come along how will they think about what a bankrupt or near
29:36
bankrupt Bond might get into restructuring again I just don't know to somebody who really is sophisticated in
29:42
AI maybe that sounds naive but to me I believe that it's likely that the
29:47
artificial intelligence dealing with a sample size of close to one on a
29:53
particular Oddball transaction may not know what to project so in effect how
29:58
does bowel practice value investing I think that we're set up not on a basis
30:05
of let's look at the world like other people we don't have industry analysts
30:10
per se we don't focus on a certain Equity list of let's know these 200
30:16
stocks or let's look at certain kinds of Industries because we like their growth prospects we're set up in a much more
30:23
opportunistic way we're inefficiencies right now and where are they likely to lie and how do we get them to come into
30:30
our inbox so we can look at them we're looking for Supply demand imbalances in the market now if you told me a stock in
30:39
Turkey is going to be delisted from an exchange I would tell you that while we don't look at Turkey we might start to
30:46
figure out that stock because when it's off the exchange and out of an index there might be a lot of people that have
30:52
to sell it and there might be a lot of people that quasi follow that index that don't hold it anymore and so all of us
30:59
sudden you've got a chance that stock price just falls into some kind of black hole I think a computer could of course
31:06
figure that out it could say de-listing leads to lower prices and then maybe make the connection that sometimes
31:12
that's overshot in some new Incarnation the company gets taken over or can come
31:18
back into an index but when you multiply that by all the kinds of things that
31:23
lead to these mispricings and imbalances is it a downgrade is it bankruptcy
31:29
filing itself what about with a private asset that Grandma dot didn't write about private assets they didn't write
31:36
about real estate they didn't write about privately owned companies yet the same general principles that cause
31:42
stocks to overshoot can cause business prices to overshoot financing becomes
31:47
less available so buyers will need to Pony up more money as equity and therefore the price drops somebody needs
31:55
to get a loan that's turning sour off their books by the end of the quarter a bank or an insurance company or a real
32:01
estate fund formed 12 years ago that has one or two more assets and once the last assets off the book so they can close
32:08
out the fund and maybe now go raise the next fund or the fund after that tracking that way sourcing opportunities
32:16
that way is so different that again I don't know what a machine could be
32:21
trained to do it's not easy to train humans to do it maybe it'll be easier to train machines but I'm not sure because
32:29
it really is a lot of sample sizes of one you see patterns but patterns don't
32:34
exactly repeat that is what we're doing that is what about post has done for 40 years we're looking hunting Broad and
32:41
wide I like to say we go miles wide to look for opportunity and then when we think we found it then we drill miles
32:48
deep maybe the contrast is that other people are going miles deep first so
32:53
they know everything about every industry they know deeply Pharma and auto and finance and whatever else but
33:01
they're not as focused on why might any of this be particularly mispriced and in
33:07
fact maybe they're actually oriented towards not going where the missed pricings are as stocks mispriced because
33:12
management has not done a good job lately that's hard for people to recommend to their clients or to their
33:18
bosses or maybe the company was involved in something that left them with a
33:24
degree of stigma a failed acquisition or a management misstep and yet those
33:29
things can cause prices to really get out of whack and lead to opportunity so that's the challenge is to find ways to
33:37
find the bargain in a sense you have to be right about less when you don't have
33:43
to be particularly right about what's the business going to grow into over the next 10 years maybe right this second
33:48
it's 30 or 40 or 50 percent undervalued now the world has changed more in recent
33:55
years so that because of technological disruption in Graham's day he could look
34:01
at a balance sheet and an income statement and say look I'm buying this stock at six times earnings and two-thirds of working capital or
34:07
two-thirds of Book value and probably be right about that and realize that the tables will turn what's out of favor
34:14
will come back into favor which is what the quote from Horus the poet that's at the beginning of intelligent investor
34:20
but what changes now is a business could be doing just fine but if somebody's
34:26
working on something in their garage that's going to disrupt that company five years from now that company May
34:31
barely exist or certainly become a lot less profitable and so an investor has to be thinking about not just cyclical
34:38
change like Graham and Dodd were worried about in the depression but secular change as well and the combination of
34:45
that I think has made investing harder and value investing harder that investors can't just crunch a few
34:51
numbers and say this is mispriced they need to dig a lot deeper than that there's nothing wrong with hard work and
34:57
I think the investors who look will continue to find mispricing and opportunity I'd love to dive into how
Pattern Recognition
35:04
you apply a lot of this at bow post and maybe the first part of that investment process is this idea of sourcing these
35:11
opportunistic areas that might be ripe for some inefficiency how do you
35:16
organize your team to look broadly to try to identify those places where you
35:21
may then want to dive in deeply I think the biggest part of it is probably pattern recognition that you
35:28
notice that patterns from the past have a way of repeating not exactly but with
35:34
some similarity you can find a fund that is in the process of liquidating its
35:40
last asset the pressures on them are you better get that asset off the books we don't want to carry it through another
35:46
year end and so all of a sudden an asset that wouldn't normally be sold now needs
35:51
to be sold with some degree of urgency it could be something as simple as realizing that a bond or a loan is about
35:58
to default or narrowing default and might then trade at a steep enough discount or that there's a restructuring
36:05
opportunity it might be that the market misperceives litigation and that either
36:10
thinks the litigation is unimportant or thinks it's more important than it really is so most investors are trained
36:17
to analyze cash flow but to guess legal probabilities I don't think anybody's probably good at that I'm not sure we're
36:23
good at that although we try but I think there are factors that are just more important in the business than they've
36:30
ever been such as that there are many many of them that add up and so I think
36:35
that the combination of that leads to some playing fields that probably have fewer people playing on them that can
36:42
lead to mispricings as well as areas that maybe are more likely to be mispriced than others so I think by
36:49
following our nose by looking for patterns by pulling on threads of similarities we end up with a pretty
36:56
good portfolio of Investments That individually likely to be mispriced and
37:01
collectively or reasonably Diversified how do you go about communicating with your counterparties so that they start
Communication
37:08
showing you more and more of these idiosyncratic opportunities I think that's part of the Intel
37:15
insighted bowel post but it's not as hard as you might think in the historic days about post 35 almost 40 years ago
37:23
we'd get a phone call hey I'm Joe Smith or Jill Smith and I'm your new coverage
37:29
for Merrill Lynch and I'd like to come by and talk about what we can do for you and time being scarce and just me you're
37:37
a very small group of people we'd say look you don't need to come by but if you guys ever see on your desk a bond
37:45
that you've never heard of or a stock you've never heard of or 20 shareholder
37:50
in a business that wants to move it quickly we're your call so don't call us with IBM insights or your new rating of
37:58
Microsoft but when you find that secondary partnership interest you find that illiquid stake in a private company
38:05
call us with that because we'll have a bid for you and so I think it's seeing those patterns and then it's a little
38:12
bit like that quote that when you come to Bao post as a young person either what we do resonates or it doesn't I
38:18
think for the great majority of our people who tend to be quite long tenured they come here and it's like they too
38:24
have been let in on a little secret and they realize that looking at what everybody else is looking at is probably
38:29
not that interesting if you're going to look at what everybody else looks at look at it in a highly differentiated way that's fine but you're not going to
38:37
make money by outsmarting people on widely followed stocks with an
38:42
undifferentiated opinion but there's a lot out there right private markets are arguably as big or bigger than public
38:49
markets the real estate market itself is thought to be around the size of global stock markets and so there's a lot of
38:56
assets and a lot of transactions and a lot of things that can be bought the
39:02
current feedback from the market is you should own the top seven stocks you
39:07
should own the stocks that are obvious you should move your money into indexes because index X's tend to outperform
39:13
stocks kicked out of an index in the short run it underperforms there's a lot of people that have to sell it nobody
39:19
that has to buy it but I would argue that over a longer period of time it's those stocks that don't make it into the
39:25
index that are actually the attractive ones because if they stay out of it you're buying the same kind of company
39:31
at a discount to the ones in the index and God willing if it's ever included in the index now you have significant gain
39:38
from the step up as well this is not an argument to index or not index it's to
39:43
say that what tends to be in favor tends to be very fully priced how it tends to be out of favor can become even more out
39:50
of favor but tends to offer better investment fundamentals literally if you and I said look there are two companies
39:56
that are identical except ones in the s p and one's not and the one that's not trades at a 20 discount which is likely
40:04
to be the better long-term investment I think we'd say on a valuation basis it's
40:09
every time it's the one not in the index maybe there's some benefits to being in the index a lower cost of capital maybe
40:16
it gives the other company some kind of Advantage but I think a value investor would generally say give me the one that
40:22
virtually the same company but at a much lower entry price I'm going to have the higher return over time and of course
40:28
looking at returns over a long period of time measuring them kind of Any Which Way the better Returns come from paying
40:35
a lower multiple of earnings the lower multiple of book a higher dividend yield whatever it is so at least that's food
40:41
for thought once you've found one of these opportunities pattern recognition
Fully vetted process
40:47
canvassing wide what is a fully vetted process that Bell post look like from
40:53
seeing the opportunity to doing the Deep dive to when you're ready to make an investment it can be days and it could
40:59
be years that depends on the nature of the opportunity I like to say that a big
41:05
enough discount maybe offsets a lack of the deepest possible knowledge sometimes
41:11
there's chaos in the markets and you want to move quickly on the other hand anybody that looks at the price and says
41:17
wow that stock has fallen 20 in the last couple of days to think that happened
41:22
for no reason would also be incredibly naive so I think that investors need to
41:29
move with the degree of alacrity because opportunities don't last forever but
41:34
they also need to do everything with a great deal of humility because the market doesn't just give away free money
41:40
there are a lot of smart people sellers might know as much or more than you they after all have owned it for a period of
41:46
time and you haven't so you ought to really spend enough time to get comfortable to at least make sure you're
41:53
not the Patsy at the table in in the way Warren Buffett would describe it we do a ton of deep work we dig deep into
42:00
company financials we look back a number of years we always ask ourselves about
42:05
not just what's the reported number but what's really going on what's the free cash flow what are the margins doing
42:12
have they gotten better have they gotten worse is this management doing good job are there missed opportunities or are
42:18
they stretching to put up good numbers that might go away so we're digging
42:23
things that have changed over the course of my career when I started there were no expert networks to call you had to
42:29
figure out your own and maybe figure out who might know something about this business or piece it together talking to
42:35
experts on certain part of the business so I would argue for sure there's way more information available we all have
42:42
more information available at no cost or low cost at our fingertips than people in the most serious investment positions
42:49
had 20 or 30 years ago but that said information is only so valuable also
42:54
because it's what you do with it it's having a differentiated view about it we have then active internal debates the
43:01
teams meet less pods which tends to be a partner and a more senior and a more
43:07
Junior analyst all together that's an approximation but that's what it looks like when they're ready to make a
43:12
recommendation they may run it by another pod just to say hey does this sound crazy we have our analysts meet
43:19
once a week at lunch anybody who's around and wants to meet the partners don't attend that so it's a free space
43:26
for analysts to be running things by each other and not feel like Partners going to hear them or they might judge
43:32
them for being naive or having a silly idea so I think that's really important for people's development when the team's
43:39
ready to pitch the idea they run it by me they run it by our president Jim Mooney as well usually at once in the
43:45
same meeting if it's a public idea we have our traders in the room who can shed insight into how the thing is
43:50
trading or any particular thoughts about what's going on in the Market at the moment on that name we reach a decision
43:56
often in an hour sometimes we don't reach a decision and we agree to reconvene or we agree that it's
44:02
interesting but not at the current price other times we'll meet we'll agree we'll buy it and then in days we're meeting
44:08
again because the prices drop further and it's now an even better bargain and do we want to own more part of my nature
44:14
is these things thrown in my head so sometimes I'll wake up after a meeting the next morning and think I forgot to
44:20
ask one question or there's a risk I hadn't thought about that now I'm thinking about and so we'll reconvene it
44:26
probably drives my people a little crazy but I always think protecting the client's capital is more important than
44:32
whether I drive somebody a little crazy so we are constantly reconvening If It
44:38
Moves closer to our price Target is this a good sale when should we get out do we sell part of it how should we think
44:43
about that if it falls should we buy more how big should it be if something else gets more interesting should we
44:50
keep holding it or is this new thing even more attractive there are two things that are limited in investing to
44:57
consider rates on every investor one is capital and the other is time and they're both really important so if
45:03
something you own Falls sometimes you'll trade out of it even though you don't like it any less than you did you're
45:09
just like something new that came along more those kinds of conversations I think are extraordinarily helpful in
45:16
optimizing a portfolio how have you gone about evolving that decision-making process that post has
Evolving decisionmaking process
45:22
grown a number of people over the years I would tell you I've done it poorly I continue to have final say in the
45:29
portfolio so the way I wield that power is I have final say but I defer a great
45:36
deal to my team so I give the team rope if it's a senior partner who's produced
45:42
a lot of profit for the clients over the years and they want to do something that I'm not sure about I tend to give them
45:48
room to do that I think that's valuable and probably career extending for them
45:53
it makes them feel appreciated gives them satisfaction that they're getting to make decisions but I also in some
46:01
sense I'm deciding on investments but I'm also deciding on people who do I trust when they say they've done the
46:07
work what does that mean have they done good work and for our best people which we have a lot of really great people
46:13
lung tenured people trusting them has been exactly the right thing to do for a very long period of time the finals say
46:19
a portfolio manager still needs to sit on top of the structure and it's because we slash money into and out of areas so
46:28
we might have loaded up on corporate credit over the last six months but if Tomorrow there's something better to do
46:34
in a private investment or in real estate we may be reducing positions we'd
46:39
like to buy something even better the organizational key is somehow to have people that are team oriented enough to
46:46
say oh I get it I worked hard on this idea I'm glad we own it but if we can own something better that's going to
46:51
make more for the clients I trust that's also in my best interest and we try to pay people not just on their own bottom
46:57
line but on a firm white bottom line for that exact reason how do you think about position sizing
Position sizing
47:04
sizing has been one of the strengths of bowel post over its history I've run into people with unusual views about
47:11
sizing so I've come across a number of funds that have a view that the goal in
47:17
investing is to limit how much you can lose on any idea so the key is to have 200 ideas in your fund none of them more
47:24
than half a percent if you don't understand that if you can establish that an idea is good versus one that's
47:31
bad then why can't you understand that there might be one that's great rather than just good and why would that not be
47:38
bigger I also think a portfolio can absorb more than a tenth or two tenths of one
47:44
percent of loss so we prefer to identify over time through continued work through
47:51
price decline that a good idea has now become a great idea or through an event through a Company announcement that the
47:58
following is going to happen and maybe you've studied the company long enough that you understand or can appreciate
48:03
right away what that news means where somebody else might think it's directionally not the direction to go or
48:09
at least not understand the impact of it so we obviously stay very far away from any line of inside information but we
48:16
want to capitalize on our insights and patients that are long-term oriented clients give us we have made our big
48:24
dollar profits over the years usually in ideas that have gone against us at first and we average down and when they are
48:32
catalyzed which means some event is going to happen that will cause us to make money we're not just dependent on
48:38
somebody waking up tomorrow and liking it more than they did today but rather the company will in fact complete a
48:45
reorganization plan or will complete a liquidation plan or a merger will close
48:50
with high probability or an asset will get sold out of their corporate portfolio and they will buy back stock
48:58
with a lot of the proceeds whatever it might be those are the kinds of catalysts we look for the presence of a
49:04
catalyst makes us comfortable having a bigger position the hardest thing about value investing without catalysts is you
49:11
can own something that's out of favor for an incredibly long time and over five or ten or longer year period
49:19
looking being early and being wrong look exactly the same and you can start to get confused and your people can start
49:27
to get confusing your clients can start to get confused and so I don't know anybody other than maybe Warren Buffett
49:33
who could underperform for a decade or more and feel like everybody's just
49:39
dandy with that because they have confidence it's going to work out and of course every investor should also be
49:44
asking themselves those questions that if you own a stock that just goes down and down and down might you have been
49:50
wrong or at least maybe you could have figured some things out earlier and not owned it from the highest price you paid
49:57
one of the things about bout post also because we know we don't know everything we know we know so little in the scheme
50:04
of how much there is to know that we spend a great deal of time trying to learn lessons and so we spend time
50:09
learning both from our successes and from our failures because they both contain valuable learnings those
50:16
learnings aren't always available the first day it may take quite a while to reflect back I remember reading years
50:23
ago in an interview they asked ahead of a mutual fund tell me about your best idea over the years and they said well I
50:30
found this stock at five dollars and it went to fifty and when I looked up that stock guess what it had gone from 5 to
50:37
50 but it was back to five so was that a great idea or was that a lucky trade I don't know the answer
Risk management
50:43
how do you think about risk management Bell post was founded on the principle of protecting the capital first and
50:50
foremost of the families that founded it and so what I would describe us as having a risk-averse approach we try to
50:56
think about downside in every individual investment we roll that into a portfolio not in some fancy math formula but
51:03
intellectually where are our correlations do we have exposure as a portfolio that's as bad as
51:11
the individual Investments or might there be much less exposure because we have offsetting Investments if this one
51:17
does well that one's likely to do less well or if this one does poorly that one's likely to be a grand slam home run
51:23
are there ways to mitigate risk just with offsets in the portfolio then you
51:28
can also mitigate with catalysts Catalyst shorten your duration they make you less dependent on the overall level
51:34
of the market in the future and we know Warren Buffett wrote in the 7374 time
51:39
frame and fortune that no one should own Common Stocks who's not comfortable with a 50 drop in the market I could tell you
51:46
almost nobody's comfortable the 50 drop of the market yet Americans own more stocks than ever before and so I think
51:53
people have forgotten that kind of admonition I think that's really important too so it's why I don't just
52:00
want pure beta Equity long diversifying in other asset classes into credit for
52:05
example shorten your duration give you a senior position and a capital structure where you're likely to get paid back
52:11
even if the equity struggles mightily or if you don't get all your money back you get 80 cents on the dollar back a lot of
52:18
things diversify away from Full Market risk it's position diversification it's
52:24
hedging at the portfolio level we tend to Overlay macro Hedges and commodity
52:30
type Hedges interest rate Hedges as appropriate based on each individual investment and they may be a layer of
52:36
portfolio Hedges that look like essentially puts on the market and the
52:42
reason for that is that the average long-term multiple of the markets about 17 times but you have moments today it's
52:49
20 times you have moments it's hit closer to 30 times and other times it gets to 10 times at times when the
52:56
market is more expensive than historic averages you are exposed like crazy to
53:02
just the multiple coming down to the long-term returns winning out and you
53:07
can lose a lot just from that kind of mean reversion so we try to protect against that too I will hold cash in the
53:14
absence of immediate opportunity that's not a terribly big number these days but
53:19
the combination of those Hedges those mitigants do provide a significant degree of downside protection and when
53:26
we do have downside it tends to be quite limited so about post has only lost money in five of its 41 years all but um
53:33
two of those have been in the mid single digit range or less so protecting Capital to that extent over four decades
53:40
I think is the name of the game for what balplus tries to do what value investors hope to accomplish
Pricing in liquidity
53:46
when you're investing in private Securities compared to public Securities how do you think about pricing in
53:51
liquidity I think you have to get paid for illiquidity I think that there is a
53:56
cost to giving up control over getting in and getting out but they're offsets and so one of the
54:02
offsets is you'd think if you bought a building it's illiquid but if you own
54:07
the whole building you get to decide when to sell it whereas if you own 100 shares of stock or a million shares of
54:13
stock of a company management could do something extraordinarily dumb that you wouldn't have done and so there are puts
54:20
and takes and so I want to make sure I get paid for giving up the right to change my mind but just because an asset
54:27
is in liquid form doesn't mean it's purely a liquid buildings get sold all the time whole companies get sold all
54:33
the time whereas 9.9 percent of the shares of a 400 million dollar company
54:40
might be a very a liquid block and so liquidity may not be what everybody seems to think there's been I think a
54:46
great misunderstanding in recent years among some people who run money that
54:52
illiquidity itself delivers degree of return that if you take the liquidity you automatically get the return I don't
54:59
think anything could be be weirder than that idea that the reason you make money from illiquidity is when you have people
55:05
on the other side of the trade who have an illiquid asset and they suddenly need to monetize it they want it off the
55:11
books that may cause it to trade at a discounted price and the discounted price provides the higher return the
55:17
liquidity itself doesn't generally when clients ask this I say you want to make several hundred basis points I don't
55:23
know if that's 200 or 500 basis points but giving up the liquidity the right to
55:29
change your mind is worth a lot on the other hand just as a thought experiment let's take the most liquid of all
55:35
instruments and let's say I found a five-year treasury bonds at a time when treasuries yield four percent and I had
55:42
a way that you could create that at a 10 yield but you couldn't trade it for five years there's a price on liquidity would
55:49
anybody do that well I would argue that anybody that's going to buy treasury bonds I would likely keep holding them
55:54
for five years ought to be first in line to do that trade and that exists I can't describe
56:00
all the ways that exist but we are trading off things like that all the time maybe the cash is in a liquidating
56:07
trust and will only get paid out slowly maybe there's something cash like or treasury bill like where the cash is
56:14
held and so it's not exactly a treasury bill but it's like a treasury bill and yet the yield is way way
56:20
disproportionately more than you'd ever get on a treasury so we're on the Eternal hunt for things like that and
56:26
sometimes we actually find them what have you found about differential risk premium and international markets
Differential risk premium
56:32
compared to the US we invest internationally we have stocks
56:37
in Europe we have debt in Europe that we sometimes buy we own real estate
56:43
globally although mostly it's U.S and Western Europe our mandate is Broad and
56:48
flexible which lets us move where the opportunity is we talk to our clients not that long ago about a few Chinese
56:54
stocks we were finding we had never owned anything in China for decades it
57:00
was in favor everybody was lining up to go there I knew that they have a pretty authoritarian system of governance and
57:07
didn't want to be on the wrong side of that we stay away from most markets like that as a pretty regular rule yet the
57:14
stocks were starting to Discount such a significant degree of China risk that we
57:20
felt like for the first time ever that you're actually getting well paid and we found a company whose stock was beaten
57:25
down 90 percent and thought that was attractive and so far so good but it's not a large percentage of our Capital
57:32
but it was very Intrepid idea by one of our analysts I don't have a view about
57:37
emergent markets about the frontier markets we're humble enough and cautious
57:43
enough to know that if you don't live in a country if you don't have people that are active in that country you're at a
57:49
real disadvantage and so I have no idea what the premium should be for buying equities in Africa or equities in Asia
57:57
but when I find a stock trading at 25 cents on the dollar I know that those
58:02
things tend to work out so that's how we've applied it but the vast majority of our investments are U.S and Western
58:09
Europe and I don't know that Western Europe needs particularly significant risk premium over the U.S obviously for
58:16
clients who live in the U.S or with exchange rate risk you may have some considerations there that wouldn't be a
58:22
big discount from our perspective we just take each individual investment as it is try to understand what the risks
58:28
and opportunities are in it and make our determination that as the economic environment's been changing with rates
Opportunities
58:34
rising and inflation particularly in the US over the last year and a half two years where is your antenna up in that pattern
58:41
recognition for the types of opportunities do you suspect will come over the next few years this is to me
58:48
one of the weirdest times since I've been in the investment business for over 40 years that you had a bubble it was
58:55
really a credit bubble that became an everything bubble super low interest rates at Time Zero rates made Capital
59:02
easily available and Incredibly cheap and that led to Startup manias and specs
59:08
and meme stocks and crypto all kinds of speculative activity I'm not convinced
59:14
that we've even begun to sort out that bubble now that bubble did a pretty good job of collapsing in 2022 but the market
59:21
has rallied back so much this year we're now in a bull market no longer in a bear Market by that at least arbitrary
59:27
definition of 20 percent I think that the damage that was done over a 12-year
59:33
Bond bubble and of course don't forget it's been a 35-year bond bull market up till 2022 that what were financial
59:40
institutions supposed to do during that time frame they couldn't get paid by taking credit risk it still wasn't much
59:47
they couldn't get paid by going out in duration the yield curve was decently flat at least part of the time and so
59:55
we've seen some financial institutions do what like Silicon Valley Bank did and end up with significant mismatches of
1:00:01
assets to deposits but I'm not convinced we know where all the bodies are buried I think here and there you read an
1:00:07
article that says this bank has a hundred billion dollars of bonds below Market or whatever but I'm just not
1:00:13
convinced I'm not saying there's anything more I don't know anything but I'd be nervous because markets cause
1:00:20
behaviors and when people have to put money to work have to run a matchbook have to run a large balance sheet
1:00:26
they're going to do something with the money we haven't seen a lot of bodies float up I don't know what that means
1:00:32
but I'd be worried I think that we've become incredibly dependent on the government rescuing everything the irony
1:00:39
of this moment is that while you had a Greenspan put in a Bernanke put and a yell input now Powell is breaking it I
1:00:48
don't know if he can break it and provide the put right afterwards on the other hand with svb we did we changed
1:00:54
all the rules around Deposit Insurance in order to not let some splatter and so
1:00:59
these are really complicated questions I don't feel like I know the answer for sure but I think the moral hazard is
1:01:06
very high I think people's memories are short I think people would be really wise to pay attention to history to
1:01:13
think back to an Era where everything didn't get rescued to try to imagine a bear Market that didn't immediately just
1:01:19
lead to a buying opportunity you'd have to look that far back people could look back to 74 5 or 73 4 many many stocks
1:01:28
trading at single-digit earnings multiples that weren't going out of business but people needed to sell stocks to pay
1:01:35
the bills and to meet their commitments you had a genuine liquidation you really haven't had much of that for a really
1:01:42
long time you had a lot of hiccups around between 98 and 01 and then the
1:01:48
great financial crisis was a really ugly 12 months or so I'm just not sure why
1:01:53
you couldn't have more trouble especially because you had enormous Capital flows and you had entire build
1:02:00
up of a private credit industry and this intermediation from Banks maybe that'll
1:02:06
all go smoothly maybe it won't it's not been tested the nature of most Wall Street Innovation is it's never stress
1:02:13
tested for a rainy day because that wouldn't be any fun it's fun to sell a lot of bonds sell out of stock sell a
1:02:19
lot of Partnerships and rake in the investment banking fees but when the rainy day comes mortgage-backed
1:02:25
Securities can blow up and wouldn't surprise me to see pockets of private credit blow up private Equity Funds has
1:02:32
been and rescued historically so in the 0809 period I always thought there
1:02:38
should be an asterisk on private Equity because those guys got rescued by the
1:02:43
FED rushing in cutting rates and congress's stimulus plans as well which
1:02:48
a lot of private Equity debt was trading down to 50 cents on the dollar and yet all those deals ended up working out had
1:02:55
that rescue not happened when it did you might see very very different numbers out of private Equity now there might be
1:03:01
an argument that private Equity is always going to be on the beneficiary side of that that might be true but it
1:03:06
also might not get rescued in some further period especially with the imbalances in our society and with Moms
1:03:13
and Pops wondering why they're rescuing wealthy Wall Street financiers so there's just a lot of uncertainty in my
1:03:19
mind about that I just think in general you know if I had to give one piece of advice to people I'd just remind them
1:03:25
study Financial history that Jim Grant likes to say science progresses securely
1:03:31
but Finance addresses cyclically and that most ideas have been around before
1:03:36
and we repeat the same mistakes and there's a lot to learn from studying
1:03:41
past periods obviously I didn't live in the Great Depression but I feel like even studying that has prepared me for
1:03:48
bad markets it's prepared me to make really tough decisions it's informed me of how bad things could get and yet also
1:03:56
emboldened me to understand that if it's not the Great Depression maybe down 40
1:04:01
or 50 percent is actually a pretty steep decline so I think the history helps
1:04:06
Center us on what a reasonable range of outcomes might be while we never lose
1:04:11
sight of what the extremes of History might dictate when you combine that study of history and this very uncertain
1:04:19
and in some ways unprecedented time how does that translate into how you're positioning the portfolio relative to
1:04:26
how you have in the past we've been Guild starved like everybody else for the last 12 years until the
1:04:33
rates started to move up a year ago we like Credit Credit often is misunderstood lends itself to
1:04:39
inefficiencies when a bond gets downgraded below investment grade there can be a natural constituency of holders
1:04:46
who want to churn out of that and that can lead to pricing inefficiencies as
1:04:51
well so we like to look at credit we like distress credit we like bankrupt debt we're not rooting for it to happen
1:04:57
but it's a playing Ground we can hunt through when those markets exist when
1:05:03
there's hardly any distressed credit they'll post has to look elsewhere so in
1:05:08
the 2010 to 2012 to 2021 period we focused more on some private markets and
1:05:15
private inefficiencies real estate for one private equity for another but it doesn't look a lot like other people's
1:05:21
private Equity it looks like more one-off hairy deals of some sort that
1:05:27
are mispriced for particular reason now we've rebalanced into credit everything
1:05:32
we do is bottom up it's not top-down asset allocation but we found enough debt to make that about 15 percent of
1:05:38
our portfolio and that's been pretty steadily growing this is not anything like Peak opportunity but I think could
1:05:45
continue to increase depending on what happens with inflation and what happens with the economy you could even have
1:05:50
economy where interest rates go down inflation gets tamed but that's accompanied by an economic downturn and
1:05:57
that could lead to more financial distress a lot of companies have taken on way more debt than probably would be
1:06:02
that prudent so that's probably the biggest change in the portfolio we are pretty well hedged we don't try to hedge
1:06:10
every ounce of risk we never have we're not a zero beta fund or anything like that but we're protected meaningfully
1:06:17
against some pretty extreme scenarios it wouldn't surprise us to encounter those that we don't really understand the
1:06:24
degree of exuberance in the market there were certainly individuals stocks were oversold in the downdraft of 22 but the
1:06:32
overall Market did not really reach bargain levels maybe it reached fairly price levels and now is rebounded again
1:06:38
to overpriced levels so I'm not making a market prediction but I do think there's
1:06:44
vulnerability so while our credit exposure has gone up or Equity exposure has gone down somewhat and we're trying
1:06:50
to focus a greater percentage of the equity book on positions with catalysts I'd love to take a step back and talk a
1:06:56
little bit about the business of about post for a long time in the early years you didn't have any
1:07:03
clients except for the family and then I guess I don't know 15 20 years ago now you did bring some institutions but been
1:07:09
very careful about who was an investor what's your perspective on the importance of that alignment between
1:07:15
what you're trying to do and who your investors are we took families By Word of Mouth in the early years about posts
1:07:21
so maybe we'd add a family or two a year but even with that our assets were still in the couple of hundred million dollar
1:07:27
range 10 years in and we took our first institutions in 98 so we're probably coming up to our 25th anniversary of
1:07:34
that and they've been great partners because they're aligned every type of client has its solidity we love
1:07:42
individuals because we can explain what we do our Founders were individuals individuals tend to think about
1:07:48
protecting on the downside at least as much if not more than institutions who
1:07:54
maybe can take a longer term view who are in competition with each other in a
1:07:59
way that individuals aren't necessarily but both types have made fantastic clients we've been very careful to avoid
1:08:06
hot money type clients short-term thinking type clients the alignment is one of the most important success
1:08:13
factors for any investor if you don't have long-term oriented clients you can't make long-term Investments and
1:08:18
since I have no idea how to make short-term Investments that work I don't know how people without long-term money
1:08:24
can invest so it's very important to have a courtship period where you meet
1:08:29
with clients literally I've had people offer US money and I've said I won't take your money until you read this
1:08:34
annual letter and you read the last five years and you understand what we do and you really appreciate
1:08:41
because we don't want to be out of alignment where we think we had a pretty darn good year and you don't so let's
1:08:47
talk about what we are trying to achieve what's attainable and what's not and I think those kinds of things have served
1:08:53
us a really good stead because it has led to a much greater overall alignment I think the endowment World especially
1:09:00
matches well for us the endowment World following you're in my mentors wisdom
1:09:06
Dave Swenson over a lot of years has worked hard to form long-term Partnerships with managers and those
1:09:13
long-term Partnerships are ones of trust and Trust being concretized through
1:09:20
actions and performance teams getting to know each other not top person a top person but deeply enmeshed throughout
1:09:27
organizations and I think from the institution's perspective the ability to
1:09:33
follow a manager through thick and thin that you can read a brochure you can talk to somebody for an hour but you
1:09:40
don't really know how to are going to handle adversity you don't know character and so it takes a long time to
1:09:46
see that play out and the same thing from the manager perspective that it helps to see how the client behaves and
1:09:52
will they be a good long-term partner will the capital be there when you need
1:09:57
it the most and so I think that alignment is perhaps one of the biggest keys to investment success over a long
1:10:04
period of Time how have you thought about the legacy of bowel post let's say you do this another 40 years but at some
1:10:11
point in time you may not be doing this I'm very cognizant that I can't and shouldn't be doing this forever I think
1:10:18
Warren Charlie are great exemplars that you can still be doing this into your 90s but I don't think I should be
1:10:25
running bow post more than another 15 or so years maybe I'll still be involved in some capacity people have done a good
1:10:32
job in some cases of stepping back still playing a role and I'd like to think as long as I'm sharp that the investment
1:10:38
skill set actually is cumulative additive thing where you may be not
1:10:43
familiar with the latest change in technology in the world but you have a large amount of perspective on what are
1:10:50
good entry points and exit points and where risks might lie so I'd like to think about post will succeed past my
1:10:57
tenure the reason I think it is we've been a great thing for our clients the clients have made a lot of money with
1:11:05
very little drawdown in the bad years and the team at Bell post has prospered
1:11:10
and we've got a 250 plus person firm and a lot of people have made their entire
1:11:16
careers here we're very proud to say we have people that have been here not just five or ten years but many people 20 25
1:11:22
30 year anniversaries which we enthusiastically celebrate a good thing that serves interest of employees and
1:11:29
clients ought to be around I will need to pull back I'll need to continue to delegate like I've been doing and find
1:11:35
more things to delegate and I continue to do that I continue to push people to take on more responsibility give people
1:11:42
promotion opportunities and truly I think right now we not only have a deeper partner group than we've ever had
1:11:49
and as talented as ever but we also have a very very deep middle of people that
1:11:55
have joined the firm in the past three five seven ten years who have tremendous
1:12:00
potential already contributing at a high level so I'm really excited at what the future can bring but I know a lot rests
1:12:07
on my willingness to give up responsibility and my ability to do it cleverly so that it take hold
1:12:15
so the impetus for you're doing this was your editing in the seventh edition of Grandma dot security analysis I'd love
1:12:20
to hear any Reflections you have on value investing of some of the contributors that you brought in to the
1:12:27
book to write new chapters on different or investment disciplines I was a co-editor of the sixth edition
1:12:34
and we had the idea in that Edition that
1:12:39
none of us were going to take the fifth edition or an earlier Edition and strip it down and provide fresh examples it
1:12:46
would have taken five or ten years nobody is certainly nobody with a day job like mine could do that so we wrote
1:12:52
covers over each of the important sections so we wrote about a historical perspective Jim Grant provided that
1:13:00
Jim's such a brilliant historian Roger Lowenstein provided a perspective on what the market had been up to since the
1:13:06
prior Edition and so they both did a reprise of that for this Edition Jim's piece is fabulous I didn't think he
1:13:13
could top himself but he wrote again about what the world was like in Graham's day and how an investor ought
1:13:19
to think about that today the importance of financial history as I emphasized and Roger wrote about the last 15 years and
1:13:26
frankly it was very helpful for me because living through it still isn't the same as like a play by play in your
1:13:33
ear but remembering all of the fads and bubbly aspects of the last 15 years and
1:13:39
how long and painful that's been for Value investors because money has tended to flow into growth and out of value
1:13:46
some of which by the way justifiably because disruption and a lot of businesses have had their long-term
1:13:52
prospects damaged but nevertheless I think in many ways a big overshoot as
1:13:59
people have become less patient and less willing to hold any investment through thick and thin the most important thing
1:14:06
I think we realized is that Grandma Dodd wrote about equities they wrote about credit they did not write about
1:14:12
International and so we have a section on International investing what's different about it they didn't write
1:14:19
about private asset classes which are really important they're really important about post I think they're
1:14:24
really important in general as a way to think about where value is the David Abrams section on the lessons of invest
1:14:31
testing in both public and private assets and how they hand in hand can
1:14:37
make you better at each which is what Warren Buffett says that I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor and
1:14:42
I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and then Seth Alexander who's another wonderful Protege of Dave
1:14:49
Swenson and somebody you and I both know and appreciate wrote about endowment management and I wanted that because I
1:14:56
wanted the perspective not just of somebody who's picking stocks or bonds but somebody who's actually in the
1:15:04
business of giving out money to money managers somebody who's thinking about stewarding a large pile of assets over a
1:15:10
very long-term period and doing it in a unique way that is differentiated from
1:15:15
what everybody else in the field is doing and I know I got the best example of that out of current endowment
1:15:21
management what a great thinker Seth is and a wonderful guy and he jumped on the
1:15:27
chance to do this which I wasn't sure I'd be able to get him but truly it's a broad group of contributor years I mean
1:15:32
we have Todd Combs who is one of the right-hand men of Warren Buffett he doesn't talk much in public but he has a
1:15:38
great section about bottom-up fundamental analysis and how important that is to him and his approach we have
1:15:44
somebody who's not been heard from that much Dominique Miel but she wrote a beautiful book about her investing
1:15:50
called Damsel in distressed she was focused on distressed debt when she was at Canyon Partners she's funny and a
1:15:58
wonderful writer Dominique has a great section Nancy Zimmerman has a really important section on Arbitrage in
1:16:05
investing in how to think about that in terms of market inefficiency and value investing but I could go on and on it's
1:16:12
a really strong group a variety of different approaches and I think it holds together really well I didn't say
1:16:18
it but I wrote the preface that was meant to be as good as I know how what
1:16:23
has changed in the last 15 years and what has changed in the last 89 years so when you take Graham and Dodd and you
1:16:29
say this is the Bible this is what they wrote what part of it still applies what's the Intel Inside where's the beef
1:16:37
and what has changed and to do both of those with an attempt to have this be
1:16:42
that if nobody updated this for the next 50 or 100 years there'd still be a lot of beef here for future readers which I
1:16:49
think we've accomplished but we'll find out Seth somehow we've gone an hour and a half without mentioning the phrase
1:16:54
margin of safety so I feel like I have to ask you about the one book that you
1:17:00
wrote and whether you have any Reflections on margin of safety that you
1:17:06
wrote 30 years ago now and whether you're thinking about an update to that high-priced scarce book only available
1:17:12
on eBay it truly has gone out of print maybe at some point I'll bring it back I have an
1:17:18
idea in my head of what might be a companion Edition that could make sense of bringing it back in some way when
1:17:24
this project came up I knew that I could only do one or at least one at a time so I thought this thing deserved to be
1:17:30
updated a lot of change in the world in 15 years I thought I knew a good group of contributors and when I called them
1:17:36
to see if they'd be willing and they all said yes I felt like now I had to go forward but I got a great team there's
1:17:43
some ample reason that I could redo or new addition of margin of safety I would talk more about process I talk about
1:17:49
culture and investment firm I talk about the flexibility of approach in that you
1:17:55
don't need it to look exactly the same as it looked last year or five years ago that the markets evolved the kinds of
1:18:01
Securities that exist about I would talk much more about private Investments and the applicability of gram and Dot
1:18:08
principles to private Investments I did some of that in my preface but I would greatly elaborate on that and look the
1:18:13
other other thing about margin safety is it's 30 years old and I think part of it was meant to be just an intellectual
1:18:19
continuation of intelligent investor and I think I achieved some of that there
1:18:24
are some things in it I wouldn't write today some things I think are just wrong I didn't really do a good job on
1:18:29
understanding the value of intangible assets for example the world of distressed debt still applies and is
1:18:36
still really interesting but there'd be whole new sections on that because the game has changed and for the worse
1:18:42
probably so there's a lot to be said there's an old saying somebody told me after I wrote that book the saying is
1:18:49
it's good to have written a book and it is good to have written a book it's not good to be writing a book and especially
1:18:55
when you've got a day job it was hard enough when I wrote that book that I had two small kids so my hands are full but
1:19:02
it's not impossible that I would bring it back in some way I still love that I stole the title blatantly from
1:19:08
intelligent investor because it's such a great expression and it really captures what a value and investor tries to do
1:19:14
you need to leave room because you might be wrong markets might go against you but if you're patient you can find a
1:19:21
margin of safety and having one means you're likely not to be in tears when a
1:19:27
lot of other investors are I'd love to Circle all the way back to the beginning with your studying of baseball stats and
1:19:34
I want to ask you about two personal Investments which may not at all fit into your value investing framework so
1:19:40
one which you've been involved with for a long time the Boston Red Sox how did you think about that as an
1:19:47
investment when your day job is so focused on the analytics of value investing
1:19:52
so as a lifelong baseball fan as a Moneyball fan as a Red Sox fan after I
1:20:00
transplant it up here the story behind it is somebody had approached me to buy
1:20:05
into the Celtics when that franchise changed hands something like 20 years ago and I thought about it I thought
1:20:12
hard but I passed because I felt like my true love was baseball and I said to the sports agent who was marketing it look
1:20:19
I'm going to pass but if you ever see a slice of the Red Sox give me a call and four or five years later he called he
1:20:26
was a former Patriot actually he was a wide receiver for the Patriots Randy vataha and he called and I bought
1:20:33
somebody else's State I didn't know if it would be a good investment it was probably 30 times current cash flow what
1:20:40
I thought was it would be fun and I said to my wife I said this might be crazy it's not money we absolutely have to
1:20:47
have and it might be a good investment but it's bound to be fun it turned out to be a way better investment that I
1:20:53
would have thought as good as any investment one could have made that was a fractional interest in a team and
1:20:58
those were trading probably relatively inexpensive compared to where the team would have traded and the team has done a brilliant job under the operational
1:21:06
leadership of Sam Kennedy who's the best CEO of anything in the whole Sports World which I think most people would
1:21:11
actually agree with and they've grown the value of the business enormously John Henry and Tom Warner have also
1:21:17
built a huge amount of value in their activities and their leadership so it's
1:21:22
been great and it turned out to be a value investment I didn't know it was but the real return has still been the
1:21:27
fun it's just been enormously fun to be part of it to go to meetings and express
1:21:33
a few thoughts here and there and my wife and I go more than we ever did and that also has been fun not only for me
1:21:39
but for her as well so the other one circling back to Stats and sports and
1:21:44
maybe even Baltimore you've been involved in horses yep and I think twice had a horse win the Preakness at filmico
1:21:52
yep we'd love to have you share a little bit about that experience and horse handicapping as it relates to investing
1:21:59
so when I was a kid we used to go to the races after school literally Junior High
1:22:05
School we'd run home throw our books down head up to the track they'd let you in free 10 minutes before the eighth
1:22:10
race and you'd bum a program and a racing form off some old guy who was leaving and you'd handicap quickly and
1:22:18
put down a few dollars and or sometimes you get an old guy to bet for you as well since you were too young legally to
1:22:23
do it then I'd go home and do my homework so I just love the analytical
1:22:29
experience of handicapping it's not the same as investing but it has commonality
1:22:34
you take an enormous amounts of information it's highly disparate you need to factor in so many different
1:22:41
considerations of the horse and the trainer and the jockey and the track condition and the distance and the who
1:22:49
else is in the race and likely Pace scenario the race you need to factor in a lot lot and I love that analysis at
1:22:55
some point a friend from childhood said why don't we buy a horse together which probably happens a lot and is always a
1:23:01
terrible idea it was a terrible idea in terms of making money it was a fun idea
1:23:07
and that led me to stay involved and so I have horses and have been incredibly
1:23:13
fortunate in the last couple of decades to win the Preakness twice it's a race
1:23:19
that for me it's as good as winning the Derby it's the middle Jewel of the Triple Crown well it's not the Kentucky
1:23:26
Derby it's really special and to do it on my home field three blocks from where I grew up is very special so that's been
1:23:32
a lot of fun I know that you don't often do this when it's not tied to philanthropy so I
1:23:38
wanted to make sure I had a chance to take the opportunity to get your thoughts on philanthropy
1:23:43
just to touch on this one thought about philanthropy relates to this book because I pledged all the proceeds and
1:23:50
royalties from this book and as well as a master class I recently did to
1:23:55
increase diversity in the investment field so I'm giving all of the money to three organizations SEO something called
1:24:03
lighted Pathways and girls who invest all of whom are bringing people that are
1:24:09
underrepresented in the investment business into the business this summer girls who invest for example has 207
1:24:17
Scholars who are rising College Juniors who have found out about the program
1:24:22
applied to it it's selective and are going to be scattered out at different investment firms and endowment offices
1:24:28
and other related types of Enterprises and getting exposure they get trained at
1:24:35
Wharton for five or six weeks and then they do their summer job for the next six weeks not everybody will love it but
1:24:41
a lot of people have their eyes opened this summer bow post will have three girls who invest but about a dozen
1:24:47
interns total spread out across the organization from I.T and HR and
1:24:54
Communications we have interns pretty much up and down the organization and we
1:24:59
feel great about it it's good for our team to be doing that we actually have long been convinced that having a more
1:25:05
diverse team makes us better as a firm diversity of thought diversity of experiences challenging existing
1:25:12
thinking it just has to make us better and so we want to always be part of that
1:25:17
this was an example of philanthropy to further an end my wife and I formed a foundation over 30 years ago when I
1:25:24
first started to make real money we joined the giving pledge a number of years ago we've already given away over
1:25:30
half and continue to make that a priority it's a lot of fun it's a challenge philanthropy focuses on the
1:25:37
world's problems and they're called problems for a reason if they had easy solutions they wouldn't be called
1:25:42
problems we work on some things in biomedicine and health care we are doing
1:25:49
some really interesting things in Israel both in medical research but also with the Arab population trying to bring
1:25:56
people into the 21st century in terms of diversifying their Workforce and
1:26:02
creating opportunity for kids of all backgrounds in Israel to get a great Science Education and then to have
1:26:09
career opportunities and working with companies to be more welcoming to people to end up with more diverse workforces
1:26:15
and it's actually taking off it's actually starting to work and we feel like that's one of the really important
1:26:20
things we're doing we do a lot in the local Boston community and Beyond the Massachusetts Community probably the
1:26:27
single biggest area right now is democracy funding because you know about how threatened American democracy is in
1:26:35
terms of what happened in 2020 but also in terms of kicking people off the voter
1:26:40
rolls and gerrymandering and making voting harder in general this is not what a healthy democracy
1:26:47
does and of all the things I want for my kids obviously I want good health but I
1:26:53
also want them and their kids and their grandkids to live in a democracy democracy has been the most important
1:26:59
thing in my life that I can't imagine what my life would have been like if I didn't grow up in the United States or
1:27:04
Britain or Canada or somewhere I don't want that for them and a lot of the trends are disturbing and we're in a
1:27:11
very difficult fraud time for America I obviously want the country to come back together but I especially needed to come
1:27:17
back as a democracy so that's become a very large area of funding we're focused on organizations that protect the vote
1:27:24
organizations that defend against litigation organizations that are
1:27:30
fighting gerrymandering that are innovating in types of election structures that might lead to better
1:27:35
outcomes maybe more Centrist candidates well Seth I don't want to let you go
1:27:40
without asking a couple of fun closing questions so what's your favorite hobby or activity outside of work and family
1:27:47
but I'm a Red Sox fan I love going to the Red Sox I love thinking about their next move and imagining what the GM job
1:27:54
might be like because it's I think not that different from a PM job only much harder what's your biggest pet beef I
1:28:02
think as an individual I don't like people who take each other for granted I think that it's easy to get busy it's
1:28:09
easy to go on autopilot but I think it's really important to stop and ask the extra question especially care about the
1:28:16
people that you care about and live that way in investing I get frustrated at the
1:28:22
short-term orientation I think it's so pernicious it's easy to fall into that trap and to have investment success you
1:28:30
have to fight that successfully I also get stuck on the idea that stocks can be
1:28:35
valued to the penny that I believe in the concept of a range of value that there's no exact price for a business
1:28:42
when you read Wall Street reports they see you know our price Target is 52.50 why don't we save between 50 and 60. but
1:28:49
if you buy it at 35 you're okay I think that would be for the best what investment mistake have you made
1:28:56
that you'll never make again this isn't a profound one but it's my first one and I don't know that anybody
1:29:03
knows about it I've never talked about it but in the earliest days about post we had this great idea there was a
1:29:09
closed end publicly traded mutual fund that had omitted some dividends and it was in arrears and as you know they have
1:29:16
to clean those up before they can pay common dividends and this company had announced that they were going to be
1:29:22
cleaning them up and paying a giant dividend and the stock went up a lot to what I thought was full value so I sold
1:29:27
it and then I realized I was two weeks away from going long term so giant mistake just from sloppiness
1:29:35
now I have an operations team that would never let that happen back then I didn't I knew it but I didn't stop and check so
1:29:42
it just made me realize again I have to check every detail which two people have had the biggest
1:29:48
impact on your professional life I think there are three but they're in different categories the two are Max
1:29:55
Heinen Michael price for Mutual shares from Max I learned to be kind to people
1:30:01
and from Mike I learned to never stop pulling threats but the third is my wife
1:30:07
who's been so supportive that without her and everything she did to organize
1:30:12
our family and take care of the kids when I was unavailable writing my book or working or on a business trip I
1:30:19
couldn't have done it so it would be those three what's the best advice you ever received
1:30:24
and what context did it come to you Max Heine told me that I ought to take a
1:30:31
Dale Carnegie course on public speaking and I didn't know what was behind that
1:30:37
but when I reflect Back Being able to communicate your ideas being good public
1:30:43
speaker being comfortable with that are just so important Max saw in me that was
1:30:48
an area that wasn't as strong as it could be and so almost 40 years ago I give him enormous credit I'm glad that I
1:30:55
took his advice it was so spot-on with teaching from your parents as most
1:31:01
stayed with you philanthropy mom and dad got divorced when I was young but each
1:31:06
of them wrote checks to their colleges for checks to various organizations that
1:31:11
were on their near and dear list and I found that motivational and inspiring that I realized that it's also important
1:31:19
to me the same way to give back to repay organizations that have benefited you in
1:31:25
your life all right Steph last one what life lesson have you learned that you wish you knew a lot earlier in life
1:31:31
something a famous investor said to me once which is to never be afraid to bet
1:31:36
on yourself obviously my career path was a bet on myself but I also probably
1:31:43
would have done even better if I had had more confidence about the uniqueness of the kinds of opportunities I was Finding
1:31:50
earlier in my career I never want to look back I never want to whine and complain about Coulda Woulda Shoulda
1:31:55
maybe I could have made a few more dollars but I think the advice that don't be afraid to bet on yourself is
1:32:02
really important it's advice I give to young people all the time I don't tell them to go start a fund but once you're
1:32:08
out there once you feel ready don't sell your business apply yourself make your
1:32:14
business as good as it can be so that applies to me too we each bring whatever qualities we have and whatever dreams we
1:32:22
have to everything we do I was just fortunate that I had the opportunities I did and I think part of that advice
1:32:28
essentially is make the most of the opportunities that are made available available to you Seth thanks so much for this rare
1:32:34
opportunity to take so much time and share your great wisdom and experience thank you it was a lot of fun as you predicted thanks for listening to the
